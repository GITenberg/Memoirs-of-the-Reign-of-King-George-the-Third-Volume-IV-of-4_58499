<p class="center b2">1769.</p>

<p>Thus ended the year 1769, leaving a prospect of
very gloomy scenes at hand. In the last reign the
House of Lords had acquired a great ascendant in
the legislature; at the beginning of the present,
the Crown had aimed at, and well nigh attained, an
increase of the prerogative. The people were now
grown formidable both to the King and Lords, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
openly attacked the House of Commons, their best
real support. Against all the branches of the
legislature the contest was certainly unequal, but
the vibrations of the balance proved how nicely
the constitution was poised. Yet so tremulous an
equilibrium made it the more to be feared that one
or other of the scales might preponderate. The
union of all three against the people, by the Lords
and Commons being sold to the King, was still
more formidable. I shall conclude the history of
the year with what relates to foreign politics.</p>

<p>The tide was turned in favour of the Russians.
The victorious Grand Vizir, who had checked their
success, was removed by an intrigue of the Seraglio;
and his successor rashly venturing to give battle,
was defeated with great loss: Choczim was taken,
and Prince Gallitzin, who had been recalled on a
notion of having failed, destroyed the Turkish army
before he received the news of his disgrace. France
and Spain were tempted to molest the Russian
fleet as it should pass through the Mediterranean;
and, as it was received and favoured in our ports,
it was not improbable but the three powers would
be drawn into the vortex of the war. We had
actually subsisting with France a quarrel that disposition
to a rupture would easily have blown up
into very serious discussion. A French ship had
come into one of our ports, but refused to lower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
her pendant. On being fired at, the French captain
continued to refuse striking the pendant, but
declared himself our prize. France presented a
strong memorial, and threatened reprisals. A
parallel case had happened in Sir Robert Walpole’s
time, who had yielded the point by breaking the
captain for one day, and promoting him the next.
At this time a vigorous answer was returned, and in
harsher terms than Mr. Conway thought necessary,
who asking Lord Weymouth at Council if he had
looked into the former case, he replied, No—and
sent away the memorial without examining it.
Lord Weymouth, as will appear hereafter, was not
apt to avoid hostile measures.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> Two thousand
sailors were ordered to be raised: but so inattentive
were the Ministers to any system, and so impossible
was it for naval commanders, or West Indian
governors to obtain the shortest moments of audience,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
that this fervour of flippant resolution seemed
a mere tribute to national clamour, not the consequence
of any methodical determination.</p>

<p>The situation of the Duc de Choiseul dispelled
those clouds. Prone as he was to attack us, and
impatiently as he wished for occasions of signalizing
his ambitious genius, his master’s pacific and indolent
humanity, the embarrassed state of the French
finances, and the storm ready to burst on his own
head, left Choiseul neither means nor power of embroiling
Europe farther. Their funds were deficient,
their army not paid, and the Prime Minister was
too extravagant and too volatile to attend to details
of economy, or to strike out any considerable plans
of frugality. He could neither find resources, nor
men who could find any. D’Invau,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> an honest man,
whom he had made Comptroller-General, fairly
abandoned the trial in less than a year. It was a
strange succedaneum on which the Duke pitched, and
which in a man less mercurial would have spoken
despair. He refused to select a new Comptroller,
and told the King that the Chancellor ought to
choose one,—thus screening himself from blame if
the successor should fail, as was most probable; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
at the same time certain, that a man placed by
his enemy would not, if successful, prove a friend
to one that had not recommended him. Maupeou,
the Chancellor, was a very able man, as false as
Choiseul was indiscreetly frank, and had long been
that Duke’s most shameless flatterer.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> The Duke’s
true friends had warned him against raising Maupeou
from the post of Vice-Chancellor to that
of Chancellor. Choiseul did not deny that there
was danger in it, but said, no other man was fit
for the post. Choiseul presumed on maintaining
ascendant enough to control him. Maupeou, too,
did not want confidence, but his was backed by
art and method. Choiseul despised his enemies—Maupeou
despised nothing but principles.</p>

<p>The Duc de Choiseul, denying all hostile intentions
in his Court, offered to allow us to send a
person to Toulon to see that no preparations for war
were carrying on there; and before the end of the
year, the Comte du Châtelet returned to England to
confirm the pacific assurances that had been given.</p>

<p>As the interior of the Court of France is scarce
known in this country, a short account of the intrigues
at the time I am describing, may be a present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
not unacceptable to posterity. I passed many
months at Paris in four different years, had very
intimate connections there with persons of the first
rank, and of various factions; and I spent five evenings
in a week with the Duchesse de Choiseul and
her select friends in the summer of 1769. The
Duke was often of the party; and his levity and her
anxiety on his account let me into many secrets, and
explained enough of the rest to make me sufficiently
master of the critical situation of the Minister at
that time. I must take up his story a little farther
back to make it perfectly intelligible.</p>

<p>Madame de Pompadour, who to the end of her
life governed Louis XV. by habit, by which he was
always governed, had established the Duc de
Choiseul in the Ministry, and left him in possession
of the chief share of power. Cardinal de Fleury
and she had been successively absolute: but the
King had never resigned himself entirely to anybody
else. The Duc de Choiseul had quick parts, and
dispatched business with the same rapidity that he
conceived it. His ambition was boundless, his insolence
ungoverned,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> his discretion unrestrained,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
his love of pleasure and dissipation predominant
even over his ambition. He was both an open
enemy and a generous one, and had more joy in
attacking his foes than in punishing them. Whether
from gaiety or presumption, he never was dismayed.
His vanity made him always depend on the success
of his plans; and his spirits made him soon forget
the miscarriage of them. He had no idea of national
or domestic economy, which being a quality of
prudence and providence, could not enter into so
audacious a mind. He would project and determine
the ruin of a country, but could not meditate a little
mischief, or a narrow benefit. In private his sallies
and good humour were pleasing, and would have
been more pleasing if his manner had not been
overbearing and self-sufficient. The latter created
him enemies; the former, friends.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> Among the
first were the Maréchal de Richelieu and the Duc
d’Aiguillon. To the impertinence of a fashionable
old beau,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> Richelieu added all the little intrigues<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
and treacheries of a Court, having tried every method
but merit to raise himself to the first post. At past
seventy he still flattered himself with the vision of
pleasing women<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> and governing the King, because
the King at near sixty had not done being pleased
with women. The Duc d’Aiguillon<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> was universally
abhorred. His abominable tyranny and villany in
his Government of Bretagne had made him dreaded;
and his ambition being much superior to his abilities,
he had betrayed the badness of his heart before
he had reached the object to which he aspired.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> The
Duc de Choiseul despised Richelieu, and had kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
down d’Aiguillon. They were connected before;
their resentments and views united them more intimately,
but it was the contemptible one that
shook their antagonist’s power.</p>

<p>There was a Comte du Barry, said to be of a
noble family.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> It was much more certain that he was
a sharper and a pimp, nominally to the Maréchal,
frequently so to the young English that resorted
to Paris, where he furnished them with opera girls,
and drew them into gaming. Two years before
he was known for loftier intrigues, the Lieutenant
de Police civilly warned some English lords not
to haunt Du Barry’s house, lest he should find them
there when, as he expected, he should be forced to
visit a place so scandalous. Du Barry, in quest of
a more plentiful harvest, came to London, and
exercised his vocation at taverns. In his Parisian
seraglio, was a well-made girl of the town, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
remarkably pretty, called Mademoiselle L’Ange.
After passing through every scene of prostitution,
this nymph was pitched upon by the Cabal for overturning
the ascendant of Choiseul. To ensure her
attachment to them, and to qualify her for the
post she was to occupy in the State,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> they began
with marrying her to the brother of her pander, Du
Barry. The next step was to prevail on Belle, the
King’s first valet de chambre, and first minister of
his private hours, to introduce her to the Monarch.
After such a succession of beauties as he had
known, and no stranger to the most dissolute, too,
the King was caught with such moderate charms,
which had not even the merit of coming to his arms
in their first bloom.</p>

<p>At first a sort of mystery was observed. But
the fair one gained ground rapidly, and Solomon
soon began to chant the perfections of his beloved.
The Court was shocked to hear to what an idol
of clay they were to address their homage. They
were accustomed to bow down before a mistress—but
took it into their heads that the disgrace consisted
in her being a common girl of the town.
The King’s daughters, who had borne the ascendant
of Madame de Pompadour in their mother’s life,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
grew outrageous, though she was dead, at the new
favourite, for being of the lowest class of her profession;
and instead of regarding this amour as only
ridiculous, treated it with a serious air of disobedience,
that would have offended any man but so
indulgent and weak a father, or a very wise one.
The poor King blushed, and by turns hesitated and
exalted his mistress. In private the scene was
childish: his aged Majesty and his indelicate concubine
romped, pelted one another with sugarplums,
and were much oftener silly than amorous.
The Faction did not sleep: the next point was that
Madame du Barry should be presented publicly.
The King promised: her clothes and liveries were
made.</p>

<p>Instead of attempting to remove or buy the new
mistress, the Duc de Choiseul’s conduct was as
imprudent and rash as the King’s was pitiful. He
spoke of Madame du Barry publicly, without decency
or management; which being quickly carried
to her, and she complaining of it, he said at his
own table, before a large company:—<span class="lote" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">“Madame du
Barry est très mal informée; on ne parle pas de
catins chez moi.</span>” The King’s irresolution and the
Minister’s insolence, suspended the abjection of the
courtiers. Even the men avoided the mistress;
and when the King proposed to carry any of them
to her, they excused themselves, slipped away, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
were silent. Had they never been mean, such conduct
had been noble.</p>

<p>In this suspense, inquiry was made for some lady
of great rank to present the new Countess. Not
one could be found that would stoop to that office.
Maréchal Richelieu was forced to fetch an obscure
lady from Bordeaux. The presentation, however,
was delayed. Madame, the eldest of the King’s
daughters, took to her bed, and protested she would
not receive the mistress. This stopped it for some
time. The Duc de la Vauguion, Governor of the
Dauphin, a great bigot and partisan of the Jesuits,
went to Madame, and advised her to be civil to the
Countess. She asked him if he came by the King’s
orders? He said, No, but as a well-wisher to her
Royal Highness. She bade him instantly quit the
room: and the hypocrite reaped nothing but the
shame of having prostituted himself to so scandalous
an office for the good of the Church—the
zealot party hoping everything from the rising
Cabal—and, in fact, as despotism soon took such
strides under the new influence, enthusiasm had
reason to flatter itself with a restoration, too, under
a doating Prince, a common strumpet, an old
debauchee, and a profligate swindler, aided by
such adjuncts as the Head of the Law and
D’Aiguillon, who breathed the very spirit of the
Inquisition. This junto soon called a female saint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
to their counsels, the Carmelite Louisa, the King’s
youngest daughter; and the poor Monarch divided
his leisure between Capreœ and Mount Carmel.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Duc de Choiseul went so
far as to talk of resigning, if the presentation took
place. Arrogant as he was, this bravery was not
solely of his own growth, but inspired by the
women of his connection. Of all human kind,
there were not two beings so insolent as his own
sister, the Duchesse de Grammont, and her friend,
the Princesse de Beauvau.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> These amazons took it
into their heads to brave the King and his mistress;
and, though the creatures of favour, were so transported
by this imaginary heroism, that they urged
the Duke to resign in defiance. This impertinence
in Madame de Grammont was absurd beyond measure.
Subsisting but by her brother’s power, abhorred
for her haughtiness, suspected of many
gallantries, and notorious for one that ought to
have been the most secret, what could she expect
from his fall but universal neglect? The Princess,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
no Penelope, was hurried on by equal impetuosity,
and by rancour, to another person, whom I shall
mention presently: yet, divested of their passions,
both these viragos had uncommonly good understandings.
There was a third person, who it was
more surprising took the same line, though regulated
by the same decency that governed all her
actions. This was the Duchesse de Choiseul, a
woman in whom industrious malice could not find
an imperfection, unless that charming one of <em>studying</em>
to be a complete character. She was too virtuous
to fear reproach or contagion from civilities
to the mistress, and should have left it to the
Duchess and Princess to be disdainful prudes.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
Yet in a quiet style she was not less earnest than
they in soliciting her husband not to bend to the
ignominy of the hour. The King, who, by a singular
situation, opened all letters, having the chief
postmaster his own creature, and not the Minister’s,
read the Duchesse’s importunities with her husband;
and as he had expected more duty from her, resented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
her behaviour more than that of the two
other dames.</p>

<p>After an anxious suspense of three months, and
when the public began to think the presentation
warded off, it suddenly took place. The King returning
from hunting, found (no doubt by concert)
Maréchal Richelieu, who was in waiting in the outward
room with a letter in his hand. The King
asked what it was? “Sire,” said the Duke, “it is
from Madame du Barry, who desires the honour of
being presented to your Majesty.” “With all my
heart,” replied the King; “she may come to morrow,
if she pleases.” This was said aloud. The
Duc de Choiseul and Versailles learnt the news at
the same moment. Next day all Paris was there to
see the ceremony.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding such indications of the Cabal
being possessed of the King’s confidence without
the privity of the Minister, the faction of the latter
had established such a tone, that the person of all
France who seemed most in disgrace, was the new
mistress. The men, indeed, began by degrees to
drop their visits at her apartment, and then sparingly
to appear at her toilet. The women shunned
her as they do an unhappy young damsel, who has
fallen a victim to a first and real passion. At
Marly, in the very salon with the King, it was a
solitude round his mistress: and one or two of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
ladies attending the Mesdames deigning to leave
their names at her door, were scratched out of the
list for Marly by <em>Madame</em>. On the other hand, the
Duchesses de Choiseul and Grammont and the
Princesse de Beauvau, refusing to stoop even to that
piece of form, were totally excluded from the
King’s suppers. Instead of being mortified, they
engaged all their female relations in the same insult.</p>

<p>It became necessary for the King to form a new
set of company; yet all his authority could assemble
but five or six women of rank, and those of the
most decried characters, except the last I shall mention.
There was Madame de l’Hôpital, an ancient
mistress of the Prince de Soubize; the Comtesse
de Valentinois, of the highest birth, very rich but
very foolish, and as far from a Lucretia as Madame
du Barry herself. Madame de Flavacourt was
another, a suitable companion to both in virtue
and understanding. She was sister to three of the
King’s earliest mistresses, and had aimed at succeeding
them. The Maréchale Duchesse de Mirepoix<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
was the last, and a very important acquisition.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
No man, no woman in France, had a superior understanding;
and it was as agreeable as it was
profound. Haughty, but supple, she could command
respect even from those that knew her; and
could transform herself into, or stoop to, any character
that suited her views. All this art, all these
talents, were drowned in such an overwhelming
passion for play, that though she had long had
singular credit with the King, she reduced her
favour to an endless solicitation for money to pay
her debts. Her constant necessities were a constant
source of degrading actions. She had left off
red, and acted devotion to attain the post of Dame
d’Honneur to the Queen; the very next day she
was seen riding backwards with Madame de Pompadour
in the latter’s own coach. In one of her
moments of poverty she had offended Choiseul by
matching her nephew, the Prince d’Henin, with
the daughter of Madame de Monconseil, a capital
enemy of the Prime Minister, but rich and intriguing.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>
To accelerate the Prime Minister’s ruin,
to secure her own favour, and in opposition to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
sister-in-law, the Princesse de Beauvau, Madame de
Mirepoix now united herself strictly, not only with
the mistress, but with Maréchale Richelieu, who,
having killed her first husband, the Prince of Lixin,
thirty years before in a duel, had been obliged, as
much as possible, to shun her company. But in all
this scene of hatred and intrigue, nothing came up
to the enmity between the Maréchale and the
Princesse. That the latter boasted of it was not
surprising. The former, as cool as the Princesse,
was outrageous—confessed it too. The first fruits of
her complaisance, was a gift of an hundred thousand
livres from the King. One day she attempted
to explain away this reward to her niece, Madame
de Bussy. “It was promised to me,” said Madame
de Mirepoix, “a year ago; but from the disorder of
the finances I did not obtain it till now; but it
was not in consideration of my attention to Madame
du Barry.” “No surely, Madam,” replied the other;
“it would not have been enough.”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
The King having gratified his mistress, was very
desirous of preserving peace; and, as usual, unwilling
to change his Minister. The Duc de Choiseul
availed himself of this indolence, and, to re-establish
the appearance of his credit, obtained the recall of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
the Parliament of Bretagne, the deepest wound he
could inflict on the Duc d’Aiguillon. The latter
returned the blow. The Duc de Chaulnes was
dying;<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> D’Aiguillon treated with him for the purchase
of the Chevaux legers, and secretly, by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
mistress’s influence, obtained the King’s consent.
The Duc de Choiseul laboured to defeat it, but in
vain. Now again to prop his credit, he procured to
have the Procureur-General du Châtelet sent to the
Bastille, for announcing that he was to be Comptroller-General
in four days. This was an able man,
and a creature of the Cabal. The King, too, was
prevailed on to say in council, that he heard there
were reports of an approaching change in the ministry,
and did he know the authors, he would thrust
them into a dungeon. To revive their hopes, the
mistress herself carried the Duc d’Aiguillon his new
patent.</p>

<p>At the same time, probably by the King’s direction,
in hopes of some accommodation, the mistress
sent for the Duc de Choiseul. He replied, If she
wanted him, she might come to him. She sent
again that she was not dressed, and must see him.
It was to ask preferment for that very postmaster
that was his enemy. The Duke went; and though
he staid an hour and a quarter with her, came away
refusing her request; and leaving her, who had
been only an instrument of the Cabal, an offended
principal. The weakness of this conduct was the
more remarkable, as he had the example of his immediate
predecessor, the Cardinal de Bernis, before
his eyes.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> From an indigent, sonnet-writing abbé,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
Madame de Pompadour had raised Bernis to the
Cardinalate, and to the office of Prime Minister.
In six weeks he refused to wait on her in her
apartment, as if incompatible with his sacred dignity—and
as if ingratitude was compatible with it!
In six days she sent him to his bishopric.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>At Fontainebleau, hostilities were carried very
high, but came to no decision. It was known, that
though the Duc de Choiseul had staid so long with
the mistress, he had rather exasperated than softened
her. When they were partners at whist with
the King, she made faces and shrugged up her
shoulders at the Minister. The King disapproved
this, and forbade it. One night after the Court’s
return to Versailles, the Maréchal de Soubize, playing
against her, said to her on her scoring two by
honours, “<span class="lote" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Non, Madame, vous n’aviez pas les honneurs;
vous n’aviez que le roi.</span>” The King laughed,
and so did the mistress violently; it being said
without design, by Monsieur de Soubize, who was
extremely decent, and not hostile to her. Had he
been her friend, he could have decided the contest
at once to the ruin of Choiseul; for Soubize was
better than any man with the King; and, had he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
not wanted ambition, might have been minister
himself.</p>

<p>With all her antipathy to Monsieur de Choiseul,
Madame de Mirepoix had too much parts not to be
sensible of his, and of his engaging vivacity. One
day, that to please her Madame du Barry was railing
at the Duke, she caught herself, and said, “<span class="lote" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mais
comprenez vous, Madame, qu’on puisse tant hair un
homme qu’on ne connoit pas?</span>” Madame de Mirepoix
replied, “<span class="lote" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Je le comprendois bien moins, Madame,
si vous le commissiez</span>”—as flattering and genteel
a compliment as could be made by an enemy.</p>

<p>The desperate state of the finances brought the
Duke as near to his ruin as the Cabal could do.
His new Comptroller-General, to whom he paid
unbounded court, to give him spirits, could, as
everybody had foreseen, produce no effectual plan;
and though he offered one, it was rejected by the
majority of the Council. The man, who was upright,
desired leave to retire, said he had done his best,
and had neither enriched himself nor his friends.
The King ordered Choiseul to name another. Aware
of the difficulty, and to avoid furnishing his enemies
with a new handle for accusing him of miscarriage,
he threw the burthen off himself, saying, it was the
Chancellor’s business. Maupeou, the Chancellor,
named the Abbé du Terray, who immediately set
out, with a violence and rigour beyond example, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
only lessening pensions and grants by the half, but
striking at the interest on the debt; and was on the
point of blowing up the credit of France entirely,
especially with foreign countries. Choiseul probably
inflamed the bankers of the Court; and then harangued
so ably in Council against such breach of
faith, that he carried it against the Comptroller, to
make good their foreign engagements, the King
himself saying, every man must tax himself, and
that he himself had two thousand louis-d’ors, and
would give them to support public credit.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> This
victory, and the clamours of the sufferers, endeared
Choiseul more than ever to the nation. At the
same time he gave a dangerous wound to his capital
enemy, the Duc D’Aiguillon, who, perceiving
the horror he had raised, or that had been raised,
by the story propagated of having attempted to have
La Chalotais poisoned, petitioned the King to allow
him to be tried for his conduct in his government
of Bretagne. Choiseul, under pretence of justifying
him, prevailed on the King, not only to consent,
but to order the trial in his own presence at Paris,
whither the Parliament was ordered to repair and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
be prosecutors,—a measure big with a cruel alternative;
as, if guilty, the Duc D’Aiguillon would
not be able to conceal his guilt from the King;
and, if acquitted, the novelty of the trial, and the
known partiality of his master, would seem to have
screened him from conviction. The Parliament was
very averse to this new mode, but was obliged to
acquiesce; and so great vexation did the accused
undergo, that at the very beginning of the trial it
threw him into a jaundice. After the trial had gone
on for many weeks, the King suddenly put a stop to
it, forbade all further proceedings, declared his approbation
of the Duc d’Aiguillon’s whole conduct,
and that the latter had done nothing but by his
orders, and for his service—a sentence, that left the
public at liberty to surmise the worst, when the
criminal did not dare to trust his cause even to so
partial a protector! The sequel of these intrigues
will appear in the following years.</p>

<p>I shall add, as notes to the foregoing account of
the Court of France, some remarkable passages that
will throw more light on it. I have mentioned the
friendship of the Duchesse de Choiseul for Madame
du Deffand. The Prince de Beauvau was so attached
to the latter that he scarce ever missed seeing her
one day when he was in Paris: and as I had known
him above thirty years, and came so often to Paris
and lived so much with them, he and the Princess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
talked their politics before me without reserve. One
day in particular, after the Duc de Choiseul’s fall,
and the removal of the Prince from his government
of Languedoc in consequence, Madame du Deffand
was expressing her fears to the Prince and Princess,
that he would be removed also from his post
of Captain of the King’s Guard. “Oh!” said the
Prince, “the King will not take that from me for his
own sake.” Madame du Deffand asked what he
meant? “Why,” replied the Prince, “he would
not think his person safe if I was not the Captain of
his Guard. When Prince Charles passed the Rhine,
I asked leave to go thither as a volunteer. The
King would give me no answer for three days, and
then refused me leave: he was afraid to be without
me.” In short, they said such strong things, that
I feared they would, on reflection, be sorry they
had gone so far before a foreigner, and therefore,
and that they might not think me curious, I rose
and went into the next room. When I returned,
the Princess, who was exceedingly quick-sighted,
suspected my motive, and questioned me whether
she had not penetrated me. When I owned she
was in the right, “Now,” said she, “you think you
have done a very civil thing, but you have done a
very rude one; for if you thought these things that
we have said too strong for you to hear, it is telling
us that they were too strong for us to utter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
With all this good sense, her haughtiness and
violence were extreme. In 1775, on the Princesse
de Lamballe being placed above the Princesse de
Chimay in the Queen’s family, the Prince and
Princesse de Beauvau would have had their niece,
Madame de Chimay, quit her place rather than
submit. Madame du Deffand disputed the point
with them. I said nothing. When they were gone,
Madame du Deffand asked me on which side I was.
I said on her’s. “Then,” said she, “how could you
be such a flatterer to them as not to take my part?”
“Because,” said I, “you argued only on their duty
to the King and Queen; but my reasons were too
strong to be given. Monsieur de Beauvau, whose
mother was mistress, and he himself a natural son
of only a Duke of Lorraine, thinks it below his niece
to give place to the Princesse de Lamballe, whose
husband’s grandfather was a natural son of Louis
Quatorze!”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>But the most extraordinary anecdote was the following
letter, which Louis the Fifteenth, when he
was endeavouring to pacify the civil war in his
Court between Madame du Barry and the Duc de
Choiseul, wrote to the latter. It is so extraordinary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
his Majesty even hinting a possibility of his <em>marrying
his mistress</em>, that I must give an account how it
came into my hands. It was read to Madame du
Deffand by the Duc or Duchesse de Choiseul, but
they would not give her a copy. However, as she
heard it more than once, she dictated to her secretary
as many of the passages as she could remember,
but disguised the names under Persian names for
fear of losing the paper or having it found in her
possession. That copy she gave me, which I here set
down, I solemnly protest, word for word as I received
it. It is a striking picture of that Monarch’s character,
full of weakness, good-humour, frankness;—and
still more of his love of quiet and disinclination
to change a Minister he was used to.</p>

<p class="center b2">1770.</p>

<p>As a question of greater magnitude had seldom
been agitated than the demanded dissolution of the
Parliament, the expectation of the public rose in
proportion as the session approached. Not that any
man supposed the King, fortified by a majority of
both Houses, would listen to that petition; but in
what manner he would reject the prayer of so many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
towns and counties, and how that rejection would
be received by men who did not seem disposed to
be corrected by reproof, was matter of curiosity to
all, and to many a subject of deep anxiety. Before
the moment arrived, it was known that the Lord-Lieutenant
had prorogued the Parliament of Ireland;
a motion had been made to inquire of him if
he was ordered or intended to prorogue them before
the usual time? He answered, that he should
always be desirous of complying with their requests,
when he could do it with propriety: that he did
not think himself authorized to disclose his Majesty’s
instructions to him upon any subject, without
having received his Majesty’s commands for so
doing. That with regard to his own intentions,
they would be regulated by his Majesty’s instructions
and by future events. Mr. Flood,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> an able
speaker, on whom Lord Townshend much depended,
moved to adjourn, that they might do no business
till they should receive a more favourable
answer, but the proposal was rejected by a majority
of 14; and the money bills arriving from England,
they were passed; and then the Lord-Lieutenant
prorogued the Parliament.</p>

<p>In England, as a signal to the hostilities that
were to ensue, the petition from Yorkshire was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
presented to the King on the 5th with several
others; but the Mayor and Corporation of Liverpool
addressed his Majesty against a petition then
soliciting in their town; and as a new mark that
the Court party, in the City of London, were recovering
ground, Alderman Harley was chosen
President of St. Bartholomew’s, the first hospital in
the metropolis, by 20 votes out of 22, against Beckford,
though a senior Alderman and then Lord
Mayor. But the want of unanimity was more
noxious to the Opposition than all the efforts of
their enemies. Lord Chatham’s profusion had involved
him in debts and great distress; and that
distress reduced him to more humane condescension
than he usually practised. He sent a message to
Lord Rockingham, professing high esteem, and
desiring a personal interview to remove former
misunderstandings, and to cement a common union
between the friends of the public. The Marquis,
with ill-timed haughtiness, replied, that he lived in
Grosvenor Square. The Earl sent again, that being
very infirm, and confined at Hayes, it would be
exceedingly kind in Lord Rockingham to come
thither—the same answer as before: how sensible!
to war on King and Parliament, and reject almost
the only ally that had any weight! Wilkes, and
the popular party in the City, Lord Rockingham
shunned like the plague. In the House of Lords,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
where he did not dare to open his mouth, and had
scarce one follower that could, he pushed back the
most admired orator of the age. Such was the
able commander under whom the campaign opened
on one side! The general on the Court side (the
Duke of Grafton) did not yield to him in trifling.
How confounded was the avidity with which all
mankind pressed for a sight of the King’s speech,
when they found not a word said on the petitions;
but instead of them, a lamentation about the
horned cattle.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> The first draught of the speech had
run in a style of commendation of the House of
Commons: this, as too insulting, Mr. Conway had
obtained to be laid aside. He did not guess that
the imagination of the Duke of Grafton could
furnish nothing more to the purpose, or more interesting
to the public, than the distemper amongst
the cattle! A preface so ridiculous could not detain
men long from the serious business in question.
In the Upper House, Lord Chatham, after descanting
on the ambition of the House of Bourbon,
turned to the election of Lutterell, and proposed an
amendment of the address, to assure the King that
they would immediately inquire into grievances,
especially those on the Middlesex election. This
motion, calculated to create a breach between the
two Houses, was not agreeable even to several of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
the Opposition;<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> but he had drawn it himself,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> and
persisted in it, telling the House he would not have
appeared but on so extraordinary an occasion. The
Chancellor spoke strongly on the same side, and
declared for the amendment; as did Lord Temple,
Lord Lyttelton, and Lord Shelburne; the latter
chiefly on the alarming posture of Europe, where
we had not, could not get, an ally. The Duke of
Grafton replied to the foreign part of the debate,
answered for the tranquillity of Europe, and said
we had not a difference there which could not easily
be settled. Lord Mansfield and Lord Marchmont
entered largely into the case of the Middlesex
election; and the former urged, that though the
House of Commons should have done wrong, a
breach between the two Houses would be much
more fatal. Lord Chatham replied, but with so
little precision and logic, as was usual with him
when reduced to argue, that Lord Denbigh and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
Lord Sandwich, both keen, and the former brutal
enough, when his brutality to opponents would be
flattery at court, ridiculed him severely; and Sandwich
professed he did not comprehend what Lord
Chatham had meant, and defied any single Lord to
give an account of what he had said. Lord Weymouth
told the Chancellor sharply, that if it was so
wrong as his Lordship had urged, to incapacitate
Wilkes, his Lordship ought not to have set the
Great Seal to the new writ—the Chancellor could
only reply that he had not read the writ.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> At ten
at night, one hundred Lords to thirty-six rejected
Lord Chatham’s amendment. Lord Dartmouth
conscientiously voted against his friends; the Duke
of Northumberland, for popularity, against the
Court.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>In the House of Commons, the success of the
Administration was less brilliant, though their majority,
as might be expected when the majority<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
consisted of the criminals themselves, was very
considerable: yet Lord Granby, swayed by Calcraft,
and leaning towards Lord Chatham, who had made
him commander-in-chief (though in truth he had
owed something to every Ministry, and had paid
them all with ingratitude),<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> balanced the credit of
the victory a little by declaring he renounced and
repented of his last year’s vote for the expulsion of
Wilkes. Dowdeswell proposed engaging to inquire
into grievances. Barré said, disregard to petitions
might teach the people to think of <em>assassination</em>.
This outrageous expression passed without censure.
Lord North spoke long and well. Conway endeavoured
to recover Lord Granby, and mentioned the
petitions with respect. Some of the members for
Buckinghamshire declared the majority in their
county had been against petitioning: and Mr.
Grenville, then under deep affliction for the recent
loss of his wife,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> pleaded that he had not signed the
petition, that he might not take any personal share
in Wilkes’s case. The Attorney-General and Norton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
censured the petitions, which Dunning, the
Solicitor-General, defended. Rigby ridiculed them,
and stated the great majority of towns and counties
that had not concurred in them. The amendment
was rejected by 254 against 138.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p>But it was next day, on the report, that the great
blow was aimed at and in the House of Commons.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>
Burke on the former day had attacked the House
itself, and hinted that the majority was so guilty that
they did not dare to take notice of the insults offered
to them, and the reproaches cast on them. On the
report he added, that he was conscious he had deserved
to be sent to the Tower for what he had said;
but knew the House did not dare to send him
thither. Sir George Saville adopted and used the
same language. Lord North took notice of it, but
said he supposed Sir George had spoken in warmth.
“No,” replied Saville coolly, “I spoke what has been
my constant opinion; I thought so last night, I
thought the same this morning. I look on this
House as sitting illegally after their illegal act [of
voting Lutterell representative for Middlesex].
They have betrayed their trust. I will add no epithets,”
continued he, “because epithets only weaken:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
therefore I will not say they have betrayed their
country corruptly, flagitiously, and scandalously,
but I do say they have betrayed their country; and
I stand here to receive the punishment for having
said so.” Mr. Conway, sensible of the weight of
such an attack from a man so respectable, alarmed
at the consequences that would probably attend the
punishment of him, and firm in his own irreproachable
virtue, took up the matter with temper, wisdom
and art, and showed the impropriety and indecency
of such language; and by that address prevented
Saville from repeating the provocation, and soothed
the House into sober concern, before any reciprocal
heat had been expressed against the offender: for
though Serjeant Glynn asserted that when the
House had been in the wrong, it was right to say
so; and though Charles Fox replied with much applauded
fire, moderation had made its impression,
and a scene was avoided that might have had the
most fatal termination. Not only was Sir George
Saville composed and ready to provoke the whole
wrath of the legislature, but had the Ministers dared
to send him to the Tower, the Cavendishes, and the
most virtuous and respectable of his friends, would
have started up, would have avowed his language,
and would have demanded to share his imprisonment.
A dozen or twenty such confessors in the
heart of a tumultuous capital would have been no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
indifferent spectacle: the great northern counties
were devoted to them. Then, indeed, the moment
was serious! Fortunately there were none but
subordinate Ministers in the House of Commons, not
one of whom chose to cast so decisive a die. The
House sat silent under its ignominy—a punishment
well suited to its demerits: and the sword was
not called in to decide a contest in which Liberty
and the Constitution would probably have been the
victims. This was in effect the critical day; for
though the struggle continued, and not without
material convulsions, yet the apprehensions of
rougher commotions wore away. Losses, dissentions,
profligacy, treachery, and folly dissipated
great part of the Opposition, and began</p>

</div>

<p>The Duke of Richmond was struck with the
violence of Sir George Saville’s behaviour, and
lamented it to Mr. Conway and me. Sir George
had told the Duke that it had been concerted with
nobody, and that he should not repeat it every day,
which would be womanish: but he was glad he had
gone so far; it would convince the county of York
that he had said nothing at the meeting which he
would not maintain in the House. He intimated too,
that if the dissolution was refused, he should go still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
farther—but he never did. I said, Sir George’s
behaviour was the more blameable for not having
acquainted his friends with his intention; he knew
them to be conscientious and men of honour, knew
they would not desert him; and thus had ventured
embarking them without their consent: he would
have been answerable for the lives and fortunes of
all who might have fallen in the quarrel. His behaviour
had tended to stir up insurrections, which
would end in the loss of our liberties, as in the
long run the Crown certainly, this King probably,
would get the mastery. Could they withstand the
King and both Houses? They had polled the nation,
and the majority by far was against them. Not a
dozen counties, and only a few boroughs, had
petitioned. What strength should they have to
support them? The greater part of England, all
Scotland to a man, and Wales, were against them.
Would Lord Chatham, would Lord Temple, would
Grenville, join them, or not be the first to make
their peace? I besought the Duke to mollify Sir
George Saville—not to countenance him. “Good
God, sir!” said the Duke, “do you think I would go
into rebellion?” Mr. Conway discussed the merits
of the question very ably, and showed it had ever
been the usage of Parliament to incapacitate improper
members. Lord Rockingham’s friends had
yielded to the incapacitation, and now disputed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
consequences. In a free government the minority
must submit to the majority, or nothing could go
on. Did it become Burke, an Irish adventurer, to
treat the House of Commons with such unexampled
insolence? “Do you think, my Lord,” continued
Conway, “that the majority will bear to hear themselves
abused daily? Do you think we are more
afraid than you are? Was it come to calling names,
or to cutting throats?” The Duke bore this remonstrance
with great temper: he had, indeed, as
I have said, been staggered at the outrage of his
friends, and I believe this conversation had so much
weight with him, as to promote his moderating,
and consequently preventing a repetition of such
hostilities.</p>

<p>Humiliating to the House as were the speeches
of Burke and Saville, that of the Chancellor had
been more inflammatory, and more provoking, as
founded in law, and coming from so eminent a
member of the Administration. The Duke of
Grafton accused him of having made no objection
to Lutterell’s admission; his friends affirmed he had;
and Lord Sandwich allowed that he had reserved
to himself a liberty of acting as he pleased on every
question relating to Wilkes. The Chancellor’s mind
certainly fluctuated between his obligations to Lord
Chatham and the wish to retain his post. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
Duke of Grafton’s neglect determined the scale.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>
The King’s Speech had borne hard upon the Colonies,
and had not been concerted with the Chancellor.
All letters to our Governors in America had promised
redress; but every post was accompanied
with contradictions, too: so that no officer in
America knew whether he was or was not to follow
his instructions; or which of his instructions was to
be the rule of his conduct. The Chancellor, judging
his fate determined, had taken his part with spirit.
The chiefs of the law and army, disgusted, might
make a dangerous schism. I persuaded Mr. Conway
to interpose with the Duke of Grafton and save<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
the Chancellor; but he found the Duke’s resolution
fixed, who told him he was to see a person of consequence
at night on that subject. I said, “That
person is Charles Yorke, who is afraid of being seen
going into the Duke’s house by day-light.” It was;
but first it had been thought necessary to make
Lord Mansfield the compliment of offering him the
Seals, who refused them, but boasted of the offer to
Sir Gilbert Elliot. The latter, dissatisfied with the
Duke of Grafton (and probably both Mansfield and
Elliot desirous of getting rid of the Chancellor),
trumpeted the secret round the town, till it came to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
Lord Camden’s ears, who told the Duke he heard
his fate was determined. The Duke did not deny it,
and they parted civilly. Thus lost Lord Camden
the Seals, valued at thirteen thousand pounds a-year.
He had saved little or no money, and had four or
five children. All he had obtained was a flying
pension of 1500<i>l.</i> a-year, till his son should attain a
Teller’s place, of which he had the reversion. As
the pension, which was granted on Ireland, had since
been included in the new tax of four shillings in the
pound on absentees, it was a littleness unworthy of
the sacrifice he had made to ask, as Lord Camden
did, to have the deduction made up to him.</p>

<p>As success had given spirit to the Court, and
had converted their fears into vengeance, another
victim was marked; this was the Earl of Huntingdon,
Groom of the Stole, a man too much vaunted
for talents which he had proved he did not possess,
and destitute of that wealth and interest which so
often supply the want of talents. By affecting personal
attachment to the King, he had escaped in all
the late changes; though his post would often have
accommodated the Administration; but the vanity
of his royal descent<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> having prompted him to ask<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
the title of Duke of Clarence, and a refusal following,
he had flattered himself with obtaining it, as
so many other titles had been wrenched from the
Crown by Opposition. He absented himself on the
first day of the session, and kept away his relation,
Earl Ferrers. The King, glad of an opportunity of
getting rid of him, too harshly sent for the golden
key. Yet few pitied Lord Huntingdon, as few had
pitied the Duke of Northumberland, who had both
paid profuse court to Lord Bute, and had both deserted
or duped him.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> The post of Groom of the
Stole was given to Lord Bristol, who rejoiced to
find himself in so secure a harbour, and piously
vowed not to risk himself by any want of the most
servile assiduity and attendance. Lord Coventry<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>
took occasion, as first Peer in the Bedchamber, to
resent Lord Bristol’s preferment; but was, in truth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
devoted to Lord Temple, and desirous of quitting
the Court; as did the Duke of Manchester, too, another
of the Bedchamber. The Duke of Beaufort
was a greater loss. He had been the first convert
of his family from Jacobitism, and now gave
up Master of the Horse to the Queen, on some private
dissatisfactions; yet, however, did not differ
with the Court.</p>

<p>Severely as Lord Camden and Lord Huntingdon
had been treated, no endeavours were spared to preserve
Lord Granby. The Duke of Grafton stooped
to every kind of intercession, but found the haughtiness
with which he had behaved to Calcraft returned
tenfold by the arrogance of that minion of
fortune, who, to ensure Lord Granby’s dependence
and resignation, now lent him sixteen thousand
pounds, additional, to a great debt already contracted.
Lord Granby accordingly, on the 17th, resigned
his post of Commander-in-Chief and Master
of the Ordnance, retaining nothing but his regiment
of Blue Guards. Lord Chatham was not less in the
power of the usurer Calcraft—so low had those
two men, who had sat at the top of the world,
reduced themselves by their dissipations! Lord
Granby’s part was the weaker, as he recanted a
vote he had not understood, for reasons he understood
as little.</p>

<p>On the 15th, Lord Rockingham requiring to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
the Lords summoned for a motion he intended to
make, the Duke of Grafton desired it might be
postponed, and that the House would adjourn for a
week; meaning, that the dismission of the Chancellor
would deprive them of a Speaker for some days.
Lord Shelburne opposed the delay with much violence,
and said the cause demanded accusation, as
the Chancellor had been dismissed for a single vote;
but no wretch would be found vile enough to accept
the Seals in his room. This was thrown out to deter
Yorke; and not a syllable of threat could be levelled
at his timidity without effect.</p>

<p>After struggling with all the convulsions of ambition,
interest, fear, honour, dread of abuse, and,
above all, with the difficulty of refusing the object
of his whole life’s wishes, and with the despair of
recovering the instant if once suffered to escape,
Charles Yorke, having taken three days to consider,
refused to accept the Seals of Chancellor. It saved
some distress to the Ministers that Sir John Cust,
Speaker of the Commons, being seized with a paralytic
stroke, sent his resignation to the House,
which adjourned to the 22nd, and gave time for
making new arrangements, when so many parts of
Government were unhinged. In no light was Sir
John Cust a loss. His want of parts and spirit had
been very prejudicial. He had no authority; and
by his sufferance of Barré’s, Burke’s, and Saville’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
insults, which he ought to have checked, had endangered
the country itself. He died unlamented a
few days after.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>The wanton insolence of the Court on the first
day’s victory, was well nigh costing them a total
defeat. They had dismissed the Chancellor without
being provided with a successor. Mr. Conway
acquainted me, in the greatest secrecy, that the
Duke of Grafton, dismayed at Yorke’s refusal of
the Great Seal, would give up the Administration.
Not a lawyer could be found able enough—or if
able, bold enough—or if bold, decent enough—to
fill the employment. Norton had all the requisites
of knowledge and capacity, but wanted even the
semblance of integrity, though for that reason, was
probably the secret wish of the Court. He was
enraged at the preference given to Yorke; yet
nobody dared to propose him, even when Yorke
had refused. Sir Eardley Wilmot had character
and abilities, but wanted health. The Attorney-General,
De Grey, wanted health and weight, and
yet asked too extravagant terms. Dunning, the
Solicitor-General, had taken the same part as his
friends, Lord Camden and Lord Shelburne. Hussey,
so far from being inclined to accept the office,
determined to resign with his friend, Lord Camden,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
though earnest against the dissolution of the Parliament.
Of Lord Mansfield, there could be no
question; when the post was dangerous, his cowardice
was too well known to give hopes that he could
be pressed to defend it. In this exigence, Grafton’s
courage was not more conspicuous. His first
thought, without consulting the King’s inclination,
was to offer the Administration to Lord Chatham
or Lord Rockingham; but inclining to the latter.
He had desired Mr. Conway to come to him in the
evening and meet Lord Gower, Lord Weymouth,
and Lord North, in the most private manner, for
consultation. Conway went away in haste to Court,
promising to return and dine with me, that he
might consider what advice he would give to the
Duke at night; but what was my astonishment,
when, in two hours, Mr. Onslow came and told me
that Mr. Yorke had accepted the Seals! He had
been with the King over night (without the knowledge
of the Duke of Grafton), and had again
declined; but being pressed to reconsider, and
returning in the morning, the King had so overwhelmed
him with flatteries, entreaties, prayers, and
at last with commands and threats, of never giving
him the post if not accepted now, that the poor
man sunk under the importunity, though he had
given a solemn promise to his brother, Lord Hardwicke
and Lord Rockingham, that he would not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
yield. He betrayed, however, none of the rapaciousness
of the times, nor exacted but one condition,
the grant of which fixed his irresolution. The
Chancellor must of necessity be a peer, or cannot
sit in the House of Lords. The Coronet was announced
to Yorke; but he slighted it as of no
consequence to his eldest son, who would, probably,
succeed his uncle, Lord Hardwicke, the latter
having been long married, and having only two
daughters. But Mr. Yorke himself had a second
wife, a very beautiful woman, and by her had
another son. She, it is supposed, urged him to
accept the Chancery, as the King offered, or consented,
that the new peerage should descend to her
son, and not to the eldest. The rest of his story was
indeed melancholy, and his fate so rapid, as to intercept
the completion of his elevation.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>He kissed the King’s hand on the Thursday; and
from Court drove to his brother, Lord Hardwicke’s—the
precise steps of the tragedy have never been
ascertained. Lord Rockingham was with the Earl.
By some it was affirmed, that both the Marquis and
the Earl received the unhappy renegade with bitter
reproaches. Others, whom I rather believe, maintained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
that the Marquis left the House directly;<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>
and that Lord Hardwicke refused to hear his
brother’s excuses, and retiring from the room, shut
himself into another chamber, obdurately denying
Mr. Yorke an audience. At night it was whispered
that the agitation of his mind, working on a most
sanguine habit of body, inflamed of late by excessive
indulgence both in meats and wine, had occasioned
the bursting of a bloodvessel; and the
attendance of surgeons was accounted for, by the
necessity of bleeding him four times on Friday.
Certain it is that he expired on the Saturday between
four and six in the evening. His servants,
in the first confusion, had dropped too much to
leave it in the family’s power to stifle the truth:
and though they endeavoured to colour over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
catastrophe by declaring the accident natural, the
want of evidence and of the testimony of surgeons
to colour the tale given out, and which they never
took any public method of authenticating, convinced
everybody that he had fallen by his own hand—whether
on his sword, or by a razor, was uncertain.</p>

<p>Yorke’s speeches in Parliament had for some
time, though not so soon as they ought, fallen into
total disesteem. At the bar, his practice had declined
from a habit of gluttony and intemperance,
as I have mentioned. Yet, as a lawyer, his opinion
had been in so high repute, that he was reported to
have received an hundred thousand guineas in fees.
In truth, his chief practice had flourished while his
father was not only Lord Chancellor, but a very
powerful Minister. Yorke’s parts were by no means
shining. His manner was precise and yet diffuse,
and his matter more sententious than instructive.
His conduct was timid, irresolute, often influenced
by his profession, oftener by his interest. He sacrificed
his character to his ambition of the Great
Seal, and his life to his repentance of having attained
it.</p>

<p>Two days after Yorke’s death the Great Seal was
put into commission in the hands of Baron Smythe
and the Judges Aston and Bathurst. Sir Fletcher
Norton had been made easy for the preference of
Yorke, by the promise of the Speaker’s chair—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
now, by an unwonted fit of decency, said he would
not profit of the Government’s distress, but would
remain Speaker. He was accordingly proposed by
Lord North and Mr. Rigby. Lord John Cavendish,
to the surprise of everybody, proposed Thomas
Townshend the younger, but confessing he had not
communicated his intention to the person he named.
Lord George Sackville concurred with Lord John,
and both threw out as many indirect aspersions on
Norton as they could with any tolerable decency—the
only reason probably for opposing him; and
that they might deny his being unanimously elected.
Townshend declared with astonishment, that he had
not only never thought of the office, but knew himself
totally unfit for it, and besought them to excuse
him. He and his family voted for Norton, who
was chosen by 237 to 121, and who, with a manliness
at least in his profligacy, took possession of his
post, without acting those stale affectations of modesty
with which other Speakers have been wont
to get themselves forced into the chair.</p>

<p>The very day on which Yorke died, Dunning, the
Solicitor-General, and James Grenville (unwillingly,
to gratify the violence of his brothers) declared
they would resign their places. That of Master of
the Horse to the Queen, was given to Lord Waldegrave.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
There also remained vacant, the posts of Commander-in-Chief
and Master of the Ordnance. Foreseeing
that the latter, if not the former, would be
offered to General Conway, fearing it would involve
him deeper with the Court, and desirous that he
should preserve his character of disinterestedness, I
early begged him to accept neither, as it would not
become him to profit of Lord Granby’s spoils, with
whom he had lived in friendship, and which would
render him unpopular. He was overjoyed at hearing
this opinion, as it was his own. Accordingly, when
the King offered him the Ordnance, he desired to
be excused, but offered to do the whole business of
Master without taking the salary; adding, that if
his Majesty would appoint no Master, he thought
he could make advantageous improvements in the
office. Lord Granby, too, would be less desperate,
if he saw his posts not filled up. The King told
Conway <em>he was a phenomenon; that there was no
satisfying other people, but he would not take even
what was offered to him</em><a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>—but as it suited the
King’s views better to find men mercenary than
disinterested, this virtue, as will appear, did not
long make impression on him. He consented to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
Conway’s plan, and told him at the same time that
Lord Granby had been agitated even to tears when
he resigned, and had told his Majesty that he did
not mean opposition: that, indeed, in cases of
state, he must follow Lord Chatham; and Lord
Camden in those of law. The King owned to Conway,
that he had frightened Yorke into accepting
the Seals by reproaching him with refusing to serve
in that distress of Government, and by assuring him
it was the last time the Seals should ever be offered
to him.</p>

<p>Sir Jeffery Amherst, the most wrong-headed of
men, would not hear of Yorke’s peerage, unless his
own was granted too. Mr. Conway showed him the
necessity of a Chancellor’s peerage, and that all who
had promises of peerages had acquiesced. It did
not satisfy him: he had resented Lord Camden’s
peerage before; and now went into the King to
resign—but was again pacified.</p>

<p>Conway himself was on the point of receiving a
more real insult. The Duke of Grafton talked to
him of destining the Mastership of the Ordnance to
some great peer, not below him in the army. This
pointed either at Lord Halifax or Lord Sandwich,
neither of whom had ever served, but ranked as
Lieutenant-Generals by having had commissions to
raise regiments, which they never raised during the
rebellion. Conway started, and declared firmly he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
would resign if such a person should be put over
him. I doubt, however, whether it would not have
been tried, if greater troubles had not intervened.
Both the Earls were poor and impatient: the Bedfords,
who had now most weight with Grafton,
favoured them—at least, preferred them to Conway.
It was not thought safe to send so unpopular a man
as Sandwich to Ireland. Thither Lord Gower
wanted to dispatch Lord Hertford once more, that
he might himself recover the Chamberlain’s staff,
the best introduction to personal familiarity with
the King—but he could compass no one of his
plans.</p>

<p>Lord Chatham had stooped in the meantime to
visit Lord Rockingham; in consequence of which
interview, and driven on by his friends who were
ashamed of their attachment to a mute, the Marquis
moved the Lords to go into the state of the nation;
delivering his proposal with all the ungracious hesitation
of terrified spirits, and hobbling through the
grievances of the nation, which he imputed to the
Court’s design of governing by Ministers unwelcome
to the people. Lord Chatham made one of his
highest coloured orations, inflaming Lord Rockingham,
whom he complimented largely, to pursue the
recovery of the Constitution, and advising him to
carry the pursuit even to extremes, the democratic
part of the Constitution having been, he said, intentionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
oppressed. In his own wild and indigested
manner he threw out, that the House of
Commons, wanted alteration; and to deliver it
from the influence of the Crown by the power of
the latter over the rotten part, the venal boroughs
and burgage-tenures, he should advise the addition
of a third member for every county. With his
usual versatility, and with more meaning, he chanted
next the sacredness of prerogative, and thence
blamed the Crown’s yielding to bind itself not to
recall the additional troops newly granted in Ireland
thence, (by which concession alone that very requisite
increase had been obtained); for himself, he declared
he would never touch prerogative, he would not
come near it, he would not pull a feather from that
master-wing of the eagle. Of Corsica, he said,
France had gained more in that pacific campaign
than she had done in the most belligerent of the last
war. He concluded with recommending union to
the Opposition for the present purpose of redress
of grievances. What might happen afterwards he
did not know—an intimation that he had not been
able to persuade Lord Rockingham to cede to Mr.
Grenville his pretensions to the Treasury. The 25th
was named for considering the state of the nation;
but when the day came, Lord Rockingham moved
to adjourn the debate for ten days, which was
allowed. The motive was, Lord Chatham’s having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
the gout in his hand. This was the more indecent
and absurd in that some of the Opposition had the
very day before protested against adjourning that
very question for a week till a new Chancellor could
be chosen. Lord Sandwich ridiculed their not
being able to go on without Lord Chatham—which,
he might have added, was saying that <em>the little finger
of Lord Chatham was heavier than the loins of the
law</em>.</p>

<p>A more important officer was wanting than even
a Chancellor. Mr. Conway had sent for me on
the evening of the 22nd. It was to tell me that
the Duke of Grafton had announced to him in the
morning that he could not get a Chancellor; that
his head turned, that he could not bear it, that he
was determined to resign: that he should not have
one great lawyer in the Cabinet to advise him; that
Lord Mansfield had been pressed to accept it and
had refused: that he could not fill up the empty
places, so many persons had resigned. The posts of
Chancellor, Privy Seal, Master of the Ordnance,
Attorney and Solicitor to the Queen, a Vice-Treasurer
of Ireland, and two Lords of the Bedchamber,
were vacant; that he had told his resolution to
nobody but to Lord Gower, Lord Weymouth, and
Lord Jersey, and to his own two Secretaries, Stonhewer
and Bradshaw. The two last, the Duke said,
approved his resolution; Lord Jersey did not. Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
Gower and Lord Weymouth had offered to stand
against the storm with him, if he would venture.
Conway had represented against the confusion into
which his Grace would throw the kingdom—but
in vain: he would hear no reasons. From the Duke
Conway had gone to the King, whom he found in
the utmost distress (or at least pretending to be),
and persuaded that the Duke was inflexible, who,
his Majesty said, had told him, his head turned.
Conway hinted at trying Lord Rockingham, but the
King said, he knew the disposition of Lord Rockingham
and his friends, and would not hear of them.
He was as thoroughly averse to Lord Chatham:
both, he said, were engaged to dissolve the Parliament;
but he would abdicate his Crown sooner.
“Yes,” continued the King, laying his hand on his
sword, “I will have recourse to this sooner than
yield to a dissolution.” He talked of trying to go
on, if Lord North would put himself at the head of
the Treasury. Conway left me to go again to the
Duke, to whom he hinted at the want of spirit in
not standing his ground; but the resolution was
too strongly taken, and he was deaf to all remonstrances.</p>

<p>The moment was indeed serious; yet, had not the
King been so thoroughly averse to the Opposition,
he would not have found them obdurate. Burke
owned to me that his friends would be content without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
a dissolution, provided an Act of Parliament
were passed to take from the House of Commons
the power of incapacitation. The Duke of Richmond
confessed the same to Mr. Conway. Lord
Chatham was never inflexible towards prerogative;
but the subservience of Lord North was more tempting;
and on him the King fixed. Lord North
owned to Conway that the King had pressed him
to accept the Treasury, professed he did not desire
it, but would undertake it rather than expose the
country to confusion.</p>

<p>Whether Lord North’s readiness to be his successor
awakened the Duke of Grafton’s jealousy, on the
25th his Grace talked of going on if the Attorney-General
De Grey would accept the Great Seal, as
the Duke expected he would. He told Conway
that he was extremely pressed to fill up the vacancies;
that Lord Sandwich teazed him to be made
Privy Seal, or Master of the Ordnance, since Mr.
Conway would not take it. Conway, who had offered
to give it up, to make Amherst easy, said, the
King had consented he should remain Lieutenant-General
of the Ordnance; and that, in any case, he
would not act under a man of so bad a character as
Sandwich, nor would see anybody else put over his
head. He was glad, he said, to hear his Grace talk
of continuing; for himself, he would take no part,
unless his Grace remained. He had no objection to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
Lord North, but had never had any connexion with
him; for the Bedfords, he knew they were his enemies.
The Duke made no reply; and Conway and
I concluded the wayward fit was gone, as, to our
knowledge, it had done so often before.</p>

<p>On January the 25th, the Commons went into a
committee on the state of the nation, when Dowdeswell
moved to resolve, that the House of Commons
is bound to follow the laws of the land and the
usage of Parliament, which is part thereof.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> Conway
said, this was a very needless declaration; it
was a truism, and admitted by everybody; the
House might as well vote that Magna Charta was
the law of the land; but he supposed this was
meant as a foundation for other questions, and
therefore he called on Dowdeswell’s candour to
state what he intended should follow. Dowdeswell
refused; and therefore Lord North said, as he supposed
the motion alluded to the case of Wilkes, he
would add the words “and had been so followed in
the case of the late election for the county of Middlesex.”
Grenville said this was unfair; and that,
in a complicated question, any member had a right
to separate the parts, and call for each distinctly.
Conway replied, that he had known questions made
complicated on purpose to destroy them; and reminded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
Grenville of Dr. Hay’s and Wedderburne’s
long and absurd addition to the question on general
warrants, which did destroy that question. Wedderburne
said, if the motion was a truism, was that a
reason for not allowing it? Would any man begin
to refuse paying a bill, by denying that two and two
make four? He went into the law part of the
question; and his position that there had been no
question exactly in point, made great impression
on the House, no man being a more acute or more
accurate speaker. Young Charles Fox, of age but
the day before, started up, and entirely confuted
Wedderburne, even in law, producing a case decided
in the courts below but the last year, and exactly
similar to that of Wilkes. “The court,” he said, “had
had no precedent, but had gone on analogy.” The
House roared with applause. Sir W. Meredith said
rudely, he wished Mr. Conway acted then with the
same patriotic spirit that he had shown on general
warrants, when he had gained the hearts of the
nation. Conway replied with fire that he hoped his
character was as good as ever, or as that gentleman’s.
Had nobody any integrity but those who
called themselves patriots? Lord Coke, the oracle
of the law, quoted the case of Hall, in the reign of
Henry the Eighth, and called it <em>the ancient usage of
Parliament</em>. Selden and Maynard held the same
doctrine. Who would dare to affirm, that those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
were not the greatest constitutional lawyers? What
was set against them but two or three pamphlets
(meaning those written by Dowdeswell and Meredith),
ingenious, indeed, but were they of weight to
be opposed to Coke, Selden, and Maynard? Sir
William Meredith was unlucky in addressing his
censure to Conway, who was in reality what Sir
William wished or affected to be, a most conscientious
man. Conway’s virtue was firm, and not to
be shaken by interest or caprice. He persisted in
uniform integrity, supported the Court when he
thought it in the right, but disdained its temptations.
He sometimes fluctuated and refined too
minutely; but if he yielded to his scruples, they
never were infused by a glimpse of self-advantage.
Sir William was not long after this gained to the
Court by a White Stick; and though he again relinquished
it, as he said, on principle, he lost more on
the side of judgment than he recovered on that of
conscience; and left it more doubtful whether he
was an upright than a very unsettled man. In an
age wherein honesty could boast few genuine martyrs,
Conway was certainly the most distinguished.
He never ceased to attest his attachment to virtue,
at the risk of a most precarious fortune; and he
had one merit that added to the beauty of his character,
and in which he was singular, that he never
mixed party or faction with his line of conduct.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
The Duke of Richmond, Sir George Saville, and
Lord John Cavendish, were, undoubtedly, of as unblemished
virtue as Conway; but they had all three
independent fortunes, and had no opportunities of
making equal sacrifices. All three, too, were devoted
to their party, and from that point of honour, which
did little to their judgment, remained inflexibly attached
to that poor creature, Lord Rockingham.
The debate, whence I have digressed, lasted till
three in the morning, when Lord North’s amendment
was carried but by 224 to 180—a threatening
diminution to the Administration, who saw their
majority on the first day of the session sunk from
116 to 44.</p>

<p>If the Duke of Grafton was alarmed before, his
panic was augmented by this decrease of forces.
He again declared to the King he would resign, yet
still desired his friends to keep the secret.</p>

<p>The next day Mr. Conway related to me two
extraordinary conversations that he had had,—the
first with the Duke himself, the other with his
secretary, Stonhewer. Conway had again tried to
encourage the Duke to be firm and surmount his
dejection; bidding him beware that there were no
Treasury secrets that might endanger him. The
Duke broke out, said he was determined to resign
immediately, for—<em>he was betrayed</em>. “There is no
man, Mr. Conway,” continued he, “on whom I can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
depend but you.” Conway was amazed. “No,”
continued the Duke, “there is no dependence on
connections. I am betrayed by my own confidential
secretary, Bradshaw. I will go to Lord North,
and press him to accept directly.” Farther, he
would not open himself. From the Duke, Conway
went to Stonhewer. The latter was a modest man
of perfect integrity, invariably attached to Grafton
from his childhood.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> He having approved the
Duke’s intention of resigning, it was probably from
being but too well acquainted with his patron’s
unfitness for the first post in the State, or from
having silently observed how dangerous it was for
the Duke to remain in so responsible an employment,
surrounded by traitors. Stonhewer told Conway
that the Bedfords had taken little or no pains
to persuade the Duke to retain his power. They
had made him believe, through Bradshaw, through
whom the negotiation passed, that the Attorney-General
was more averse to take the Seals than the
Duke found him—and Stonhewer owned that he
thought Bradshaw a villain. The King, he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
had used the Duke ill, and was not disinclined to
his resigning. Mr. Conway had had the same
suspicion.</p>

<p>The truth, I believe, of this plot and these intrigues,
was this. The King, worn out by Grafton’s
negligence, and impracticability, had wished to get
rid of him. It was known afterwards, that Bradshaw
was secretly the tool of the King and Lord
Bute, and had probably engaged Rigby to facilitate
his Majesty’s plan of suffering the Duke to resign,—which,
however, he was so unjust as to resent for a
long time after. Rigby, Lord Gower, and Lord
Weymouth, all feared that the Duke’s irrational
conduct would involve them in his fall, and Lord
Gower particularly hoped, by betraying him, to stand
nearer to the chief post. Thus they dissuaded his
resignation so faintly as rather to encourage it. The
rich reversion obtained by Bradshaw, by or for his
treachery, confirmed his share in the transaction.
The Duke and Duchess of Bedford were far from
being counsel to the resignation; in truth it was
entirely concealed from them. That the Duke
should not communicate it to them, was most extraordinary.
That Lord Gower did not, confirmed his
share in the plot. Of all the set, Rigby’s part was
the most dark. His concealing the Duke of Grafton’s
intention from the Duke of Bedford, was
unjustifiable: yet he could not trust the Duchess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
with it, as her ambition was infinitely gratified by
having her niece, the Duchess of Grafton, wife to
the Prime Minister; and as her attachment to
Rigby was cooled, she would not have bent to his
secret views. Thus they did not hear a syllable of
Grafton’s purpose till the very last day, and then
Bedford vehemently urged him not to resign: but
it was too late. Yet, if Grafton had opened half an
eye, he soon closed it, continuing his intimacy with
Lord Gower and Rigby, and his confidence even to
Bradshaw.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> Had not the Duke himself dropped his
suspicions to Conway, and had they not been confirmed
by the immaculate honesty of Stonhewer, I
should almost doubt the fact, though treachery was so
notoriously the characteristic of the Bedford faction.</p>

<p>The secret, though in so many hands, was not
less well kept from the public, than it had been
from the Duke and Duchess of Bedford; for though
Grafton resigned on the evening of the 27th, it was
not known till very late on the 30th, when Lord
North was declared the successor.</p>

<p>Such was the conclusion of the Duke of Grafton’s
Administration, which had lasted two years,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
and when he was but thirty-four years of age. His
fall was universally ascribed to his pusillanimity;
but whether betrayed by his fears or his friends, he
had certainly been the chief author of his own
disgrace. His haughtiness, indolence, reserve, and
improvidence, had conjured up the storm; but his
obstinacy and fickleness always relaying each other,
and always <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mal à propos</i>, were the radical causes of
all the numerous absurdities that discoloured his
conduct and exposed him to deserved reproaches;
nor had he a depth of understanding to counterbalance
the defects of his temper. The power of
the Crown and the weakness of the Opposition,
would have maintained him in his post, though he
was unfit for it, as immediately appeared by the
Court’s recovering its ascendant the moment the
Duke retired; for though Lord North had far better
parts, yet his indolence proved as great as Grafton’s;
but having as much good humour as the Duke
wanted, it was plain that the Parliament were willing
to be slaves, provided they could be treated
with decency. Grafton had quitted the King’s
service, when Prince, disgusted with Lord Bute:
had been captivated by Lord Chatham, yet came
into place without him; then quitted for him, Lord
Rockingham and the Whigs. He then declared
against a place of business; then gave himself up
to Lord Chatham, and was made his first Lord of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
the Treasury; grew as violently partial to Mr. Conway,
yet was with difficulty persuaded to stay in
place even with him—then would act with nobody
but him: as abruptly and lightly consented to let
him retire to make way for the Bedfords; and after
a life of early decorum, dipped with every indecency
into the most public and abject attachment to a
common courtezan, gave himself up to Lord Bute’s
influence:<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> rushed into an alliance with the Bedford’s,
whom he hated, against his interest; and at
last permitted them to betray him, not without suspecting,
but without resenting it.</p>

<p>The detail of his conduct was as weak and preposterous
as the great lines of it. His intrusion of
Lutterell, his neglecting to call the Parliament
before the petitions spread, his wasting his time
at Euston and Newmarket though the tempest
raged, his disgusting the Chancellor, and when he
had disgusted him, not turning him out before the
Parliament met, but leaving him to avail himself
of the merit of martyrdom by being turned out for
his speech and vote; and then turning him out
when it was both too late and too soon, because no
successor had been prepared in time; these wild
and inconsistent steps plunged him into difficulties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
which yet he might have surmounted, if his inconstancy
had been art, his rashness courage, or his
obstinacy firmness.</p>

<p>He was the fourth Prime Minister in seven years
who fell by his own fault. Lord Bute was seized
with a panic and ran away from his own victory.
Grenville was undone by his insolence, by joining
in the insult on the Princess, and by his persecution
of Lord Bute and Mackenzie. Lord Rockingham’s
incapacity overturned him; and now the Duke of
Grafton, by a complication of passions and defect
of system, destroyed a power that it had depended
on himself to make as permanent as he could
desire. It was pretended that his secret reason was
the preference given by the Queen to Lord Waldegrave
for her Master of Horse over the Duke’s
friend, Lord Jersey. The Duke had not asked it
for him, but was capable of resenting its not being
offered, and as capable of being influenced by that
little reason as by any of eminent magnitude.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
did not quit without signalizing his retreat by two
pensions that were loudly censured. One was to
his tool, the traitor Bradshaw, the reversion of
Auditor of the Plantations, worth 1500<i>l.</i> a-year.
The other a pension on Ireland of 1000<i>l.</i> for Dyson
stamped with a royal breach of promise; the King
having permitted the Duke of Northumberland to
pass the regal word that no more pensions for a
term of years should be granted on Ireland but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
on extraordinary occasions.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> Dyson’s merits were
not of that noisy kind that would bear to be
detailed, and yet now ranked with those of Prince
Ferdinand and Sir Edward Hawke, whose names
had been cited by the Attorney-General as proper
precedents for his Majesty’s munificence.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more distressful than the
situation into which the Duke of Grafton had
brought the King, and in which he abandoned
him. Whether it was owing to disgust, or whether
men had conceived that the Duke could not
maintain himself, the majority had suddenly dwindled
away to an alarming degree, nor was any time
given to prepare for the change. The 31st was
appointed for going again into the committee on
the state of the nation, the very business on which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
the failure of numbers had disclosed itself. A
new arrangement without new strength was not
encouraging. Lord North had neither connections
with the nobility, nor popularity with the country,
yet he undertook the government in a manly style,
and was appointed First Lord of the Treasury on
the 29th, with only one day to intervene before
it would be decided whether he would stand or
fall. Could he depend on men whom he had not
time to canvass? Was it not probable that the
most venal would hang off till they should see
to which side the scale would incline? Yet Lord
North plunged boldly into the danger at once. A
more critical day had seldom dawned. If the
Court should be beaten, the King would be at
the mercy of the Opposition, or driven to have
recourse to the Lords—possibly to the sword. All
the resolutions on the Middlesex election would
be rescinded, the Parliament dissolved, or the contest
reduced to the sole question of prerogative.
Yet in the short interval allowed, Lord North,
Lord Sandwich, Rigby, and that faction on one
side, the Scotch and the Butists on the other hand,
had been so active, and had acted so differently
from what the Duke of Grafton had done, that
at past twelve at night the Court proved victorious
by a majority of forty; small in truth, but greater
by fifteen or twenty than was expected by the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
sanguine, the numbers being 226 to 186.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> The
question in effect was, that a person eligible by
law cannot by expulsion be rendered incapable of
being rechosen, unless by act of parliament. The
courtiers moved that the chairman should leave
the chair, and carried it. Lord North, with great
frankness and spirit, laid open his own situation,
which, he said, he had not sought, but would not
refuse; nor would he timidly shrink from his post.
He was rudely treated by Colonel Barré, who
already softened towards the Duke of Grafton, to
whom he attributed weight and dignity, but expressing
contempt for the new Premier, as a man
of no consequence. The latter replied not only
with spirit but good-humour, and evidently had
the advantage, though it was obvious how much
weight the personal presence of a First Minister
in the House of Commons carried with it. George
Grenville amazed everybody by a bitter complaint
of libels and libellers hired by the Court; and this
at a season when, deserve what it might, the Court
undoubtedly laboured under an unparalleled load
of abuse. Colonel Lutterell, on the other hand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
affirmed that he had traced a most flagrant libel
home to a near relation of that gentleman, who,
he believed, was also privy to it. He had forced
the printer to divulge the writer, one Lloyd,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> who
had confessed on his knees, with tears, that Lord
Temple had forced him to practise that office.
Lutterell added that he had taxed Lord Temple
with it by letter, who had not deigned to make
an answer. Captain Walsingham said he had gone
to Lord Temple on the same errand, who had
declared on his honour he was not concerned in it.
Grenville flamed, and called for a committee to
inquire into libels. He was answered finely by
Sir Gilbert Elliot, who now, contrary to his custom
of late, took a warm part. He had been much
neglected by Grafton, though the confidential agent
of the King and Lord Bute; and never distinguished
himself, though none more able, but on
cases of emergency, and when the Court ventured
or chose to make its mind more known than by
the Minister. Elliot told Grenville that, had he
not entered into factious combinations, <em>he</em> knew
Grenville would have been entreated to save his
country. That Grenville was not pardoned and
again received into favour, proved how much more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
the King and his mother were swayed by their
passions than by their interest.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p>Frederic Lord North, eldest son of the Earl of
Guilford, was now in the thirty-eighth year of his
age. Nothing could be more coarse or clumsy or
ungracious than his outside. Two large prominent
eyes that rolled about to no purpose (for he was
utterly short-sighted), a wide mouth, thick lips,
and inflated visage, gave him the air of a blind
trumpeter. A deep untuneable voice, which, instead
of modulating, he enforced with unnecessary
pomp, a total neglect of his person, and ignorance
of every civil attention,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> disgusted all who judge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
by appearance, or withhold their approbation till
it is courted. But within that rude casket were
enclosed many useful talents. He had much wit,
good-humour, strong natural sense, assurance, and
promptness, both of conception and elocution. His
ambition had seemed to aspire to the height, yet
he was not very ambitious. He was thought interested,
yet was not avaricious. What he did, he
did without a mask, and was not delicate in choosing
his means.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> He had lent himself readily to
all the violences of Mr. Grenville against Wilkes,
had seized the moment of advancement by accepting
the post of Chancellor of the Exchequer (after
a very short opposition) when the Court wanted a
person to oppose to the same Mr. Grenville; and
with equal alacrity had served under the Duke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
of Grafton. When the first post became vacant
by the Duke’s strange retreat, no man so ready
to place himself in the gap as Lord North. It was
in truth worth his ambition, though he should
rule but a day, to attain the rank of Prime
Minister. He had knowledge, and though fond
of his amusement, seemed to have all necessary
activity till he reached the summit. Yet that
industry ceased when it became most requisite.
He had neither system, nor principles, nor shame;
sought neither the favour of the Crown or of the
people, but enjoyed the good luck of fortune with
a gluttonous epicurism that was equally careless of
glory and disgrace.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> His indolence prevented his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
forming any plan. His indifference made him leap
from one extreme to another; and his insensibility
to reproach reconciled him to any contradiction.
He proved as indolent as the Duke of Grafton, but
his temper being as good as the Duke’s was bad, he
was less hurt at capital disgraces than the Duke had
been at trifling difficulties. Lord North’s conduct
in the American war displayed all these features.
He engaged in it against his opinion, and yet without
reluctance. He managed it without foresight
or address, and was neither ashamed when it miscarried,
nor dispirited when the Crown itself became
endangered by the additional war with France.
His good humour could not be good nature, for at
the beginning of the war he stuck at no cruelty,
but laughed at barbarities with which all Europe
rung. It could not be good sense, for in the progress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
he blushed at none of the mischiefs he had
occasioned, at none of the reproaches he had incurred.
Like the Duke of Grafton, he was always
affecting a disposition to retire, yet never did.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>
Unlike the Duke, who secured no emoluments to
himself, Lord North engrossed whatever fell in his
way, and sometimes was bribed<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> by the Crown to
promote Acts, against which he pretended his conscience
recoiled—but it never was delicate when
profit was in the opposite scale. If he had ambition,
it was of very mean complexion, for he stooped
to be but a nominal Prime Minister, and suffered
the King’s private junto to enjoy the whole credit of
favour, while, between submission and laziness, Lord
North himself was seldom the author of the measures
in which he bore the principal part. This passive
and inglorious tractability, and his being connected
with no faction, made him welcome to the King:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
his having no predominant fault or vice recommended
him to the nation, and his good humour
and wit to everybody but to the few whom his
want of good breeding and attention offended.
One singularity came out in his character, which
was, that no man was more ready for extremes
under the administration of others, no man more
temperate than Lord North during his own:—in
effect, he was a man whom few hated, fewer could
esteem. As a Minister he had no foresight, no
consistence, no firmness, no spirit. He miscarried
in all he undertook in America, was more improvident
than unfortunate, less unfortunate than he
deserved to be. If he was free from vices, he was
as void of virtues; and it is a paltry eulogium of a
Prime Minister of a great country, yet the best that
can be allotted to Lord North, that, though his
country was ruined under his administration, he
preserved his good humour, and neither felt for his
country nor for himself. Yet it is true, too, that he
was the least odious of the Ministers with whom he
acted; and though servile in obedience to a Prince
who meant so ill, there was reason to think that
Lord North neither stimulated, nor was more than
the passive instrument of the black designs of the
Court.</p>

<p>The other chief Ministers were, Lord Dartmouth,
Lord Suffolk, Lord Gower, Lord Weymouth, Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
Sandwich, Lord Rochford, and afterwards Lord
George Germaine, besides two, who, though not
ostensible Ministers, had more weight with the
King than Lord North himself. Of those, Lord
Dartmouth only stayed long enough to prostitute
his character and authenticate his hypocrisy.
The Chancellor, Bathurst, was too poor a creature
to have any weight; and Lord Rochford, though
more employed, had still less claim to sense, and
none at all to knowledge. Lord Suffolk’s soul was
harrowed by ambition, and as he had not parts to
gratify it, he sought the despotism of the Crown as
means of gratifying his own pride. Lord Gower,
Lord Weymouth, and Lord Sandwich, all had parts,
and never used them to any good or creditable purpose.
The first had spirit enough to attempt any
crime; the other two, though notorious cowards,
were equally fitted to serve a prosperous Court;
and Sandwich had a predilection to guilt if he could
couple it with artifice and treachery. Lord George
Germaine was proud, haughty, and desperate. Success
by any means was necessary to restore his
credit; and a Court that was capable of adopting
him, was sure he would not boggle at anything to
maintain himself. Lord Mansfield was by birth,
education, principle, cowardice, and revenge for the
public odium, a bigot to tyranny. He would have
sacrificed the universe, and everything but his personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
safety, to overturn the constitution and freedom
of England. But in the blindness of that rage,
and from not daring to open the attempt where the
danger to himself would have been imminent, he
was the author of the liberty of America, and the
instrument of Providence to bless a whole continent,
whose destruction he sought to involve with
that of his country. Jenkinson had, and deserved,
no marked character; he was the tool of the King
and Lord Mansfield, and had just parts enough to
make his servility inexcusable. Wedderburne, Sir
Gilbert Elliot, and Dyson were also much implicated
in the following counsels; but the two latter
died early in the American war. Thurlow, Rigby,
and Ellis bore their part in kindling that fatal
flame—but I am anticipating what did not appear
till three or four years later—though it was both
necessary to specify the chief incendiaries of the
ensuing calamities, and to account for Lord North’s
escaping capital hatred for seeming to bear so capital
a part in so criminal a scene; but as not one of
the set I have recapitulated had recommended himself
to the favour of the public, Lord North, by his
good humour, easily drew most good will to himself,
and did not, like most of the rest, push it from him
by insolence and avowed profligacy. Many events
intervened, before the grand scene opened, and
those I must now detail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
From Lord North’s entrance into power, the
Court found all their facilities of governing by corruption
and influence return. Every question was
carried in both Houses by more than sufficient
majorities: and though the Ministers were teazed
within, and the King from without, Lord Chatham
was always baffled in the Lords, Dowdeswell, Burke,
and Grenville in the Commons; nor could Wilkes
in the City keep up more than an ineffectual flame.
I will recapitulate, as briefly as I can, the chief
events and debates of the following period.</p>

<p>Lord North was no sooner set at the head of
affairs, than he solicited General Conway’s support.
The latter professed great regard for him, but declared
he would not sit in council with Lord Gower
and Lord Sandwich, now the Duke of Grafton, to
whom alone he had been obliged, was retired. Conway,
accordingly, with the King’s consent, returned
no more to the Cabinet Council. The Privy Seal
was given to Lord North’s uncle, the Earl of Halifax.
Charles Fox and Charles Townshend,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> of
Hunningham, were made Commissioners, the first
of the Admiralty, the second of the Treasury. Ellis<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
succeeded James Grenville as Vice-Treasurer of
Ireland; but Lord Howe and Lord Cornwallis
resigned their places, having, as they said, had no
obligations but to Lord Chatham and the Duke of
Grafton. Dr. Blackstone was made a judge, and
Sir Gilbert Elliot succeeded Lord Howe as Treasurer
of the Navy.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>On the 2nd of February, the Lords went into the
state of the nation, on a question like Dowdeswell’s,
and sat till two in the morning, an hour
scarce ever known in that House. The Duke of
Richmond principally shone, and said he concluded
the Duke of Grafton had resigned from being conscious
of the badness of the cause. Grafton denied
the supposition; said, nobody did or ever should
know the cause of his resignation—and then entered
into the most vehement protestation of
eternal attachment to his friends the Bedfords.
Lord Shelburne and Lord Sandwich had a warm
altercation; but the most disagreeable part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
day fell on the late Chancellor, Camden. Grafton,
Gower, and Weymouth declared, on their honours,
that he had never objected to the legality of what
had been done on the Middlesex election; and the
Duke affirmed that he had not suspected Lord
Camden’s doubts till the month of August last. All
Lord Camden could say was, that he had never
been positively consulted on it, and had not thought
himself obliged to give any opinion when not called
upon; yet it appeared in the debate from Lord
Chatham, that Lord Camden had declared the illegality
to him before August—a proceeding not
quite justifiable in a Chancellor, who is styled
keeper of the King’s conscience, to be silent to
the Ministers on so important a step, and to condemn
their measures to the chief of their opponents.
The motion was rejected by 96 to 47, and then the
majority voted, that for the House of Lords to interfere
in a resolution of the House of Commons in
a matter of election would be unconstitutional, and
tend to a breach between the two Houses. Two
warm protests were signed on that occasion by the
Lords in opposition, declaring they would never
rest till the nation should obtain satisfaction on the
Middlesex election.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
On voting the land tax, Burke complained of the
new grants of pensions and reversions, and of the
hardship of levying three shillings in the pound for
such purposes. Lord North defended them by the
precedent of Lord Camden’s pension. Dowdeswell
named Dyson and Bradshaw as enjoying monstrous
and exorbitant grants, and gave notice they should
be inquired into. James Townshend, the Sheriff,
declared that as the county of Middlesex was not
fairly represented, he would not pay the land tax.
Lord North answered calmly, that the law would
decide whether he should pay it or not. The declaration,
though intended for example, was not
followed: but the Commons House of Assembly of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
South Carolina, voted 1500<i>l.</i> to the Supporters of
the Bill of Rights.</p>

<p>On the 12th, Lord Chatham moved for a resolution
that the capacity of a person to be elected did
not depend finally on a determination of the House
of Commons. This was supported by Lord Camden,
but denied by Lord Mansfield, and evaded by the
previous question.</p>

<p>Dowdeswell the same day aimed a destructive
blow at the prerogative, but one too wholesome to
meet with success.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> It was to take away votes at
elections for Members of Parliament from all under-officers
of the revenue, as of the excise, customs,
&amp;c. The motion was popular and constitutional;
but the old artillery of the Court, the Tories, were
played against the proposal, and it was rejected
by 263 against 188. Dowdeswell and Grenville
pledged themselves to promote such a bill, should
they ever be Ministers again. Lord North told
them they certainly did not think themselves likely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
to become so, when they supported such a measure.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p>

<p>On the report from the committee on the state of
the nation, a great quarrel happened between the
new Speaker and Sir William Meredith, who were
ancient enemies. Grenville had insisted on a right
of separating two questions, which being contested,
Meredith appealed to the Speaker. Sir Fletcher,
a novice in the orders of the House, made an artful
but false distinction; at the same time complaining
of the hardship of being pressed for decision in the
dawn of his office. Sir William said he had meant
nothing uncandid; but Norton, hot and unguarded,
said, “he now saw he must never expect candour
from that gentleman.” Those words caused such
an uproar for twenty minutes that nobody could be
heard, most crying out to have the words taken down.
Conway and others tried to moderate; but Barré
inflamed the heat, and Dowdeswell moved that the
Speaker’s behaviour had been an infringement of
the liberty of debate, and a violation of the rules of
the House. The Speaker was enraged, and perceiving
that so violent a motion would be rejected with
indignation, he insisted on putting the question on
himself, which was thrown out without a division.
The whole discussion lasted between four and five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
hours, protracted by the Speaker’s fault, who would
make no concession, and who desired the House to
take notice that he had made no apology to Meredith.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></p>

<p>A motion of Grenville for an account of the disbursements
on the Civil List for the year 1769 was
rejected by 262 to 165. Many reflections were
thrown out on the new grants to Sir Fletcher
Norton, Dyson, and Bradshaw; but as the majority
was again risen to ninety-seven, the Court paid no
regard to complaints. Lord North had flung himself
into the hands of Lord Bute’s junto,<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> and had
even taken for his own private secretary one Robinson,
steward to Sir James Lowther<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>—not without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
giving offence to the Bedfords, who had meant to
govern North themselves.</p>

<p>But if Lord North established his credit at Court
by recurring to the patronage of the Favourite, it
did but serve to revive jealousies of Lord Bute and
the Princess; a strong instance of which broke forth.
Sir Edward Hawke had declared for an addition
of four thousand seamen, then retracted that opinion,
but said, if he should remain in the Admiralty,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>
he should the next year be for adding five thousand
men. On this declaration of so renowned an Admiral,
Lord Craven and Lord Abingdon moved for
two thousand seamen more. The Duke of Richmond
supported their motion with great abilities,
knowledge, and matter, and pointed out the encroachments
and dangers from France and Spain in
Corsica and the East Indies, and from the formidable
Spanish fleet that seemed to threaten Jamaica,
warning the Ministers that they should be answerable
for refusing more seamen, if any mischief should
arise. Still they refused them, but with much confusion
and little argument. Lord Chatham went
farther, in his best manner and with most inflammatory
matter, perceiving how little he could hope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
either from the King or Parliament. He pronounced
that since the King’s accession there had been no
<em>original</em> Minister (a forced expression for no <em>independent</em>
Minister) in this country; that there was
a <em>secret influence</em> (which he described so as to point
at the Princess, not at Lord Bute) which governed
and impeded everything, and was greater than the
King. He drew a flattering yet artfully ridiculous
picture of the King’s gracious facility in granting
everything in his closet, while in Council or in
Parliament it was defeated by the faction of the
secret influence. He himself, he said, had been duped
and deceived by it; and though it was a hard thing
to say of himself, confessed he had been a fool and
a changeling. The Duke of Grafton, mistaking
Lord Chatham, asked whether the King or himself
had been pointed at by the Earl, and spoke with
warmth, dignity, and grace. He declared Lord
Chatham had forced him into Administration, as
he had many letters to prove; but the happiest day
of his life had been that of his resignation. For
the words dropped by Lord Chatham, <em>they were the
effects of a distempered mind brooding over its own
discontents</em>.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> This last expression hurt Lord Chatham
deeply: he repeated it over and over, and said
he had drawers full of papers to prove that he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
always had sufficient vigour of mind to avoid the
snares laid for him. He would neither retract, he
said, nor explain away the words he had uttered;
but returned the Duke’s attack with severe reflections
on his Grace’s falsehood and deviations. The
Ministers did not dare to take notice of what had
been thrown out against the Princess, but rejected
the motion by 70 to 38. The Duke of Richmond
hinted that in the late war the Emperor of Morocco
had offered to embark fifty thousand men on board
Admiral Saunders’s fleet, and invade Spain. Lord
Rockingham, the Duke of Richmond, and the
Cavendishes, who had kept aloof from Lord Chatham,
were so charmed with his attack on the
Princess, that they visited him publicly. It was
more surprising that the Duke of Grafton supported
the new Administration with more parts and spirit
than he had done his own; and in that and the following
winter recovered much of the esteem that
he had lost when in power, though without having
recourse to that usual restorative of character,
opposition.</p>

<p>On the 5th of March the House of Commons
went upon the consideration of America. Lord
North proposed to repeal all the late duties, but
that on tea. <em>Mr. Conway advised the repeal of that
also</em>, most men believing that a partial repeal would
produce no content. Grenville agreed in condemning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
as the Rockingham party did too, a partial
repeal; but, too obstinate to consent to any repeal,
went away without voting, and the motion passed.
Lord North produced letters showing that the
association for not taking our goods was in a great
measure broken through, as the Colonies found they
could not do without them. In fact, they continued
secretly to send commissioners hither for goods
while they appeared most vehement against letting
them be imported—the true reason why our merchants
did not, as having no cause, complain of the
decay of that trade.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<p>To find the petitions slighted, and to have driven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
away the Prime Minister without shaking the Administration,
was a mortifying disappointment to the
Opposition; and which, though they affected great
contempt for the leaders of the Court party, gave no
shining idea of their own abilities employed in vain
to overturn them. The next expedient to which
the opponents had recourse, did as little honour to
their invention, being nothing more than a renewal
of petitions under the title of a remonstrance; and
which, being only a variation of terms, not of means,
produced, like other such remedies, no more effect
than the dose to which it was a succedaneum. The
Liverymen of London, indignant at the King’s
making no answer to their petition, had, with the
assistance of the Common Council, and by the
countenance (if not by the instigation) of Beckford,
the Lord Mayor, obtained a Common Hall, notwithstanding
the opposition of almost all the Aldermen.
At that Hall it was determined to present a remonstrance
to his Majesty on his not having deigned
to take any notice of their petition; and the Sheriffs
attended him to know when he would be waited
upon with the remonstrance. The King replied,
“As the case is entirely new, I will take time to
consider of it, and will transmit an answer to you by
one of my principal Secretaries of State.” In two
days Lord Weymouth wrote to the Sheriffs to know
how their message was authenticated, and what the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
nature had been of the assembly in which it was
drawn up. The Sheriffs went the next morning
with a verbal message, and insisted on being admitted
to an audience to deliver it. Alderman Townshend
told the King he came by direction of the
Livery in Common Hall assembled. The King
replied, “I will consider of the answer you have
given me.” From the temper both of the City and
the Court, it was fortunate that no mischief
arose. The boldness of the former was met by the
contempt of the latter. The Remembrancer being
denied admittance into the closet with the Sheriffs,
he asked Lord Bolingbroke, the Lord of the Bedchamber
in waiting, whether it was not usual to
admit the person possessed of the office he held?
Bolingbroke replied, “I do not know: I never saw
you here before, and hope never to see you here
again.”</p>

<p>Sir Robert Ladbroke proposed to the Court of
Aldermen to declare that the remonstrance was no
act of that court or of the Corporation of London;
but the Lord Mayor refused to put the question
without consulting the books of the City; and
many reflections were thrown on the courtly Aldermen
for attempting to govern the City contrary to
its own sense. Sixteen of the Aldermen, however,
protested against the remonstrance, which, by the
King’s allowance, was carried to him on the 14th of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
March by the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs. An immense
mob accompanied them, but committed no
indecorum, except hissing as they passed Carlton
House, the residence of the Princess Dowager.
The King received them sitting on the throne.
The Common Serjeant began to read the remonstrance,
but being inclined to the Court, was so
frightened that he could not proceed, and Sir James
Hodges<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> was forced to read it. The King, with
great composure, and without expressing anger,
scorn, or fear, read his answer, which, though condemning
the address, was uncommonly condescending,
and in a style of appeal to his people.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> It had
been debated whether they should be admitted to
kiss the King’s hand. Lord Hertford, the Chamberlain,
was ordered to tell the Lord Mayor, that if
they desired to kiss his Majesty’s hand, he would
grant it. Beckford said, “I desire of all things to
kiss my Sovereign’s hand,” which they all did. In
the relation of that ceremony given the next day
in the <em>Public Advertiser</em>, it was described in this
bitter manner:—<em>the King instantly turned round to
his courtiers and burst out a-laughing—Nero fiddled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
while Rome was burning</em>. Two papers, still more
indecent, called <i>The Whisperer</i> and <i>The Parliamentary
Spy</i>, were published weekly against the
King, the Princess, and the Parliament.</p>

<p>During the above transaction, Mr. Dowdeswell
moved for the accounts of the Civil List, expressing
the different Administrations under which the debts
had been contracted. Lord North objected; but
Lord Mount Stewart,<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> desiring his father’s share
might be specified, it was accorded, as were the
rest, though, till his application, they had been refused,
notwithstanding Grenville and Dowdeswell,
both of whom had been Chancellors of the Exchequer,
and the former First Lord of the Treasury,
too, had begged to have their accounts particularized.
Grenville justly observed, that that deference
to Lord Mount Stewart’s request, proved his father’s
actual influence, and consequently Lord North’s servility
to him.</p>

<p>Lord Rockingham made the same demand of
accounts in the House of Lords, but down to that
very year. The former were granted as in the
other House; the latter part was refused. Lord
Chatham said, Sir Robert Walpole, on whom he
made great encomiums, once asking the payment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
but 113,000<i>l.</i> gave in the vouchers: now, 500,000<i>l.</i>
had been asked without any account delivered,
which had been refused even till now, though the
debt had been paid. Growing more inflammatory,
he drew a picture of the late King, who, he said,
was <em>true, faithful, and sincere</em>, and who, when he
disliked a man, always let him perceive it—a portrait
intended as a satirical contrast to the character
of the reigning monarch. On the Duke of
Grafton he was still more bitter, whom he repeatedly
called <em>Novice</em>, and whom, he said, he had
never meant for First Minister; the Duke had
thrust himself into the function, removing Lord
Camden and Lord Shelburne; but that, when the
latter was dismissed, could he have crawled out, he
himself would have gone to the King, and insisted
that the Duke should be dismissed too. The Duke
answered with firmness and sense; said he knew
Lord Chatham had wished him to hold his power
only under himself, and had meant him for a
cypher, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">regnante Cæsare</i>. The debate continued
chiefly between these two; but Lord Chatham
adding, <em>that Lord Camden had been removed for his
vote in Parliament</em>, Lord Marchmont insisted on the
words being taken down. At first Lord Chatham
was disconcerted, but soon avowed the words; and
they were taken down, though his violence was so
great that he was with difficulty compelled to sit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
down. Lord Sandwich, alarmed, moved to adjourn;
but the Duke of Richmond insisting that Lord
Chatham, being accused, had a right to vindicate
himself, and the latter declaring that he would not
retract his words, Lord Marchmont grew frightened,
and moved that nothing had fallen in that or
any former debate that could justify the assertion
of Lord Camden having been dismissed for his vote.
This modification was seized by the majority, who
finding Lord Chatham inflexible, did not dare to
push him to extremities, but meanly and timidly
voted those words, though the Opposition would not
agree to them. In the course of the debate, Lord
Temple said Lord Mount Stewart had done himself
immortal honour by desiring to have his father’s
accounts produced; and that they would, he supposed,
vindicate Lord Bute himself from many
calumnies. It was doubted whether this was
flattery, or art to draw forth the accounts, that
matter might be found in them for impeachment.
Of all the party, Lord Shelburne was most warm,
agreeable to his maxim, that the King was timid
and must be frightened. I think it was in that
debate (which was a very heterogeneous one) that
Lord Mansfield, being called upon for his opinion
on Lutterell’s case in the Middlesex election, declared
his opinion should go to the grave with him,
having never told it but to one of the Royal Family;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
and being afterwards asked to which of them, he
named the Duke of Cumberland—a conduct and
confidence so absurd and weak, that no wonder he
was long afterwards taunted both with his reserve,
and with his choice of such a bosom-friend.</p>

<p>The great difficulty was to determine what part
the King should take on the remonstrance. It
reflected much on him—more on the House of
Commons; and, in the opinion of some lawyers,
amounted at least to a misdemeanour. The first
idea was, that the King should lay it before both
Houses with complaint; but in the meantime, Sir
Thomas Clavering, a rich northern baronet, no otherways
considerable, moved the House of Commons
to address the King to lay the remonstrance and
his answer before the House, the former being, as
he concluded by the latter, very offensive. Beckford,
the two Sheriffs, and Alderman Trecothick
warmly avowed their share in the remonstrance.
Harley attacked Beckford as the disturber of the
City’s peace; and a warm altercation between them
ensued. The Opposition, particularly Wedderburne,
urged that to censure any petition or remonstrance,
unless it was high treason,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> was a direct violation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
the Bill of Rights. Lord North was very zealous,
especially in defence of that wretch, his ancestor,
the Lord Keeper, for which he was well ridiculed
by Burke, who begged the House to stop, and
reminded them how often he had warned them to
go no farther, involving themselves more and more
by every step they took. Conway answered Wedderburne
with uncommon applause, condemning
the remonstrance, but recommending moderation.
Grenville fluctuated strangely, neither condemning
or countenancing the remonstrance, but dissuading
punishment. Could they, he asked, punish all concerned
in it, or could they punish partially? Even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
Lord John Cavendish spoke for temper, and owned
the remonstrance had gone too far. The address
was voted by 271 against 108. The Ministers no
doubt had instigated that motion as less obnoxious
than a direct complaint from the Throne would have
been, and as wearing the appearance of independence
from the person who made the motion: but
the gentleman’s independence was a little sullied by
the command of Languard Fort being four days
after conferred on his brother, Colonel Clavering, a
meritorious officer, to whom it had been promised,
but which made the connection of the elder with
the Court observed.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p>Such was the dangerous and disgraceful situation
into which the unconstitutional intrusion of Lutterell
had drawn the Court. They did not dare to punish
the indignation they had provoked, lest worse consequences
should ensue: nor did their triumph in
maintaining Lutterell in his seat, compensate for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
timidity they betrayed in bearing so insolent a remonstrance,
which was one of the humiliating effects
that had flowed from their original illegality in the
prosecution of Wilkes,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a>—a speaking lesson to
Princes and Ministers not to stretch the strings of
prerogative! The whole reign of George the Third
was a standing sermon of the same kind; and the
mortifications I have been recounting were but
slight bruises compared to the wounds he afterwards
received by not contenting himself with
temperate power and established obedience.</p>

<p>The remonstrance and answer being delivered to
the House, Sir Thomas Clavering and Sir Edward
Blackett<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> moved a resolution, that to deny the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
validity of proceedings in Parliament was unwarrantable,
and tended to disturb the peace of the
kingdom. The Opposition objected to the question,
as the House of Commons, being the party accused,
ought not to judge in their own cause; and the
previous question was moved. The day passed temperately,
except that Beckford and Harley gave one
another the lie. The courtiers were moderate, and
the Rockingham party decent, which kept the Lord
Mayor and Sheriffs within bounds. Dunning made
a great figure against the Court; but the resolution
passed, the previous question being rejected by 284
to 127.</p>

<p>The next day the same Baronets moved a loyal
address to the King. The debate turned on the
infringement of the Bill of Rights, by questioning
petitions in Parliament. Lord John Cavendish,
Wedderburne, and Sir Joseph Mawbey, acknowledged
the remonstrance to be improper, but defended
the right of remonstrating; and Lord John
proposed a less fulsome address. Mr. Ridley, and
Sir Matthew Ridley, his son, declared, they said, in
the names of the country gentlemen, whose silence
avowed them, that they had gone thus far with the
Administration, but would go no farther if punishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
was thought of: yet Rigby talked highly for
severe proceedings, and reviled the Livery and the
Opposition. Beckford, not at all content with these
last for supporting him no better, yet vaunted his
own firmness and ridiculed the merchants who had
addressed the last year, calling them <em>contractors</em> and
remittancers; and scoffing at the courtiers in plain
terms for serving for such scanty pay, in comparison
of contractors who made 5000<i>l.</i> or 6000<i>l.</i> a year.
Lord North himself, he said, had not above 2000<i>l.</i> a
year. Lord North offered to the Cavendishes to
omit the most exceptionable parts of the address;
but as they would not close with him, it was voted
by 284 to 94.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> The Lords, on the 22nd having
had a conference with the Commons, concurred in
the address. Lord Chatham was confined by the
gout. Lord Shelburne alone avowed the language
of the remonstrance. Lord Denbigh and Lord
Pomfret were, on the other hand, as gross in flattery
to the King. Lord North’s moderation, concurring
with the opinion of many lawyers, that the
remonstrance was no misdemeanour, prevented any
farther views of punishment on that subject.</p>

<p class="center b2">1770.</p>

<p>These debates were tedious and unentertaining,
and willingly I abridge them: totally omitted they
could not be; they were the constituent ingredients
of an inglorious reign, in which many of
the most solemn questions that compose or touch
the essence of our constitution were agitated—questions
that will live in our law-books, when
omitted in polished histories written for entertainment.
These pages, therefore, will serve for a clue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
to writers on the laws, though they may not be so
fortunate as to please the idle. I shall slightly
mention some other bills that were discussed about
the same time.</p>

<p>Mr. Herbert,<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> a near relation of the Earl of Pembroke,
and a young man of great fortune and good
principles, proposed a bill to declare that expulsion
did not imply incapacitation unless for certain crimes
infamous by law. Doubts were started on what
those crimes were. The House was strongly inclined
to the bill: the Ministers pretended not to
discountenance it—but the Jesuits of the Treasury,
Dyson and Jenkinson, undermined it indirectly: the
latter went so far as to engraft a clause on that bill
calculated to secure the rights of freeholders, which
would have made it an instrument of tyranny, and
would have made expulsion or imprisonment total
incapacity. Lord North affected to be struck by and
to approve that juggle; but Lord Beauchamp,
General Conway, and even the smooth courtier
Lord Barrington, resisting, and the latter declaring
that it was necessary to quiet the minds of the
people, Lord North gave it up. The Cabal however
clogged the bill with so many subtleties and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
contradictions, that Mr. Herbert abandoned it with
indignation, and it was lost.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p>Mr. George Grenville was more successful with a
bill that the profligacy of the times loudly demanded,
and which even that profligacy could not defeat.
It was to take the trials of contested elections from
the judicatory of the House, and vest them in a
smaller number of examiners to be chosen by ballot.
Important as the nature of elections is, and sacred
as the property of legal votes, of the right of counties
and boroughs to choose their representatives, and of
the elected to his seat, yet all was overlooked, and
petitions were heard and decided solely by favour or
party. Nor was this accidental, but constant and
universal. Grenville’s bill was generally liked.
Rigby and Dyson opposed it, and at last Lord
North, who endeavoured to put it off for two
months; but he was defeated by 185 to 133.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
The resistance of the House to the power of the
Administration on those two bills, proved, with some
instances I have mentioned, that that House of
Commons was not implicitly servile on all occasions
like the last. Grenville’s bill passed on the 2nd of
April, but not without a remarkable conversation
rather than a debate on political creeds and secret
influence. Grenville and Dowdeswell declared
they had been under none when they were in place.
Samuel Martin desired the House to take notice of
that declaration. It was evidence, he said, that
Lord Bute was falsely accused; and that such
rumours were raised to excite the mob against him
on his return from abroad. Colonel Barré said
the <em>two gentlemen</em> had only declared they had not
been influenced <em>themselves</em>: but Lord Chatham had
solemnly affirmed to the Lords that even in six
weeks his schemes had been controlled; and it was
evident where the secret influence lay, when Martin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
and Jenkinson, the servants of the Princess of
Wales, and when Dyson and Sir Gilbert Elliot, were
so much consulted. That was the cabinet that
governed the Cabinet.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> Lord North declared that
he would be nominal no longer than he was real
Minister. There wanted no better proof of the
secret influence than that Lord Bute had the credit
to maintain Oswald, Elliot, Dyson, and Jenkinson,
or some of them, in the Treasury through every
Administration subsequent to his own, by which he
might be master of all the secrets of that important
board which influences the whole Government,—at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
least they were agents whom he had recommended
to the King; and if the Earl himself did not preserve
the same degree of credit with his Majesty,
the King acted on the plan in which he had been
initiated, and had cunning enough, as most Princes
have, to employ and trust those only who were disposed
to sacrifice the interest of the country to the
partial and selfish views of the Crown; views to
which his Majesty so steadily adhered on every opportunity
which presented itself, that, not having
sense enough to discover how much the glory and
power of the King is augmented by the flourishing
state of the country he governs, he not only preferred
his personal influence to that of England, but risked,
exposed, and lost a most important portion of his
dominions by endeavouring to submit that mighty
portion to a more immediate dependence on the
royal will. Mystery, insincerity, and duplicity were
the engines of his reign. They sometimes procured
success to his purposes, oftener subjected him to
grievous insults and mortifications, and never obtained
his object without forfeiting some share of
his character, and exposing his dignity to affronts
and reproach from his subjects, and his authority to
contempt from foreign nations. He seemed to have
derived from his relations the Stuarts, all their perseverance
in crooked and ill-judged policy without
profiting by their experience, or recollecting that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
<em>his</em> branch had owed the Crown to the attempts
made by the former Princes at extending the prerogative
beyond the bounds set to it by the constitution.
Nor does a sovereign, imbued with such
fatal ambition, ever want a Jefferies or a Mansfield,
or such less ostensible tools as the Dysons and Jenkinsons,
who for present emolument are ready to
gibbet themselves to immortal infamy by seconding
the infatuation of their masters.</p>

<p>Beckford, the Lord Mayor, gave a great dinner
to the lords and gentlemen of the Opposition: a
cavalcade of the Livery fetched and escorted the
company from the Thatched House Tavern in St.
James’s Street; and at night many houses were illuminated,
and a few had their windows broken for
not being lighted. Lord Chatham had, by earnest
entreaties, engaged Lord Granby to carry him to
the Mansion House in his chariot, but was prevented
by the gout from joining in the procession,
which his pressing a popular general to head, did
not seem calculated to promote tranquillity. In
fact, no efforts were spared to keep up the spirit.
The freeholders of Westminster met and voted a
remonstrance, which, omitting the most exceptionable
parts of that from the City, was immediately
presented to the King. Another was voted by the
freeholders of Middlesex; but no answer was given
by his Majesty to either.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
A few of the Opposition, who acted with decency
and impartiality, condemned the violences of their
party. Sir William Meredith complained of the
letters of <i>Junius</i>, of <i>The Whisperer</i>, and of <i>The Parliamentary
Spy</i>. Thurlow, the new Solicitor-General,
in the room of Dunning, said a prosecution was
commenced against the first. General Howard again
complained of <i>The Whisperer</i>; and a conference
being desired with the Lords, it was voted an infamous
and seditious paper.</p>

<p>Lord Chatham, who seemed to imbibe faction
from disappointment, desired the Lords might be
summoned for after the holidays, as he intended to
propose a bill to endeavour to repair the mischief
done by the iniquitous decision of the House of
Commons on the Middlesex election; nor was he
less intent on raising jealousies of the designs of
France. He pronounced, in the month of March,
that by that very day on which he was speaking,
the French had <em>somewhere</em> struck a hostile stroke.
This asseveration making great noise, alarmed the
merchants, who sent a deputation to him, to inquire
<em>where</em> the blow was struck. He denied having said
so; and some who were present, declared they had
not heard him say it. This was merely negative
and personal to themselves, for, in general, his audience
were positive as to the words; and it was not
less remarkable, that a year afterwards, when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
seizure of Falkland’s Island by the Spaniards became
public, Lord Chatham’s partisans affirmed that he
had made such a declaration, but had accused Spain,
not France, of having committed hostilities. He
did not even spare the King, but accused him of
duplicity. The Duke of Grafton defended the royal
accused. The King soon afterwards asked General
Conway if he ever saw the Duke, and where he
lived? Conway said he knew nothing of him: “Nor
I,” said his Majesty; “he has not come near me these
six weeks; nay, when I heard of his defending me
against Lord Chatham, I wrote a letter of thanks
to the Duke; he not only did not answer my letter,
but has taken no notice of it since.”</p>

<p>On the 17th of April ended the imprisonment of
Wilkes, and he was discharged from the King’s
Bench, whence he retired privately into the country,
affecting to decline the congratulations of his
fellow citizens. The next night many houses of
the lower rank were illuminated, but without any
tumult. The Court had taken care to prevent any
disturbance, by stationing numbers of constables,
and by holding the Guards and Light Horse in
readiness. Beckford had affected like solicitude,
giving out orders for peaceable behaviour, but on
pretence of the Easter holidays; while his own
house in Soho Square was decorated with the word
<em>Liberty</em>, in ample capitals. Wilkes, now entering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
again on the scene, published an address of thanks
to the county of Middlesex, and another to the
ward of Farringdon. In those and former addresses,
he had the assurance to talk of protecting our <em>religious</em>
as well as civil liberties. When Lord Sandwich
informed against the “Essay on Woman,” <em>he</em>
too talked religion. It was impossible to decide
which was the more impudent, the persecutor or
the martyr! The release of Wilkes was celebrated
at Lynn, Norwich, Swaffham, Bristol, and a few
other towns, but not universally. At the end of
the month, he was sworn in Alderman of Farringdon
ward. The solid retribution was the work of
the Society of the Bill of Rights. They paid or
compromised a great part of his debts, disbursing
seven thousand pounds for him.</p>

<p>Zeal for his cause reigned almost as strongly in
the city of Westminster. Having lost one of their
members by the death of Lord Sandys, whose son,
one of their representatives, succeeded to his father’s
title, they elected Sir Robert Barnard, a knight of
Huntingdonshire, known to them only as an enemy
to Lord Sandwich, in his own county,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> and by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
having presented its remonstrance to the King.
The Court did not dare to set up a counter candidate,
though seated in the heart of Westminster,
amidst their own and the tradesmen of the nobility.</p>

<p>Samuel, Lord Sandys, died by a hurt from an
overturn. He had formerly been the head of the
republican party, and a leader against Sir Robert
Walpole, on whose fall, he was made Chancellor of
the Exchequer, a promotion that cost him his character,
both as a patriot and a man of business. He
was soon removed for his incapacity, and made a
peer; and, at different times, filled other posts, as
Chief Justice in Eyre and Speaker of the House of
Lords; but never recovered any weight, and at last
was laid aside with a pension.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p>At the end of the month arrived a very alarming
account from Boston. Some young apprentices had,
incited to it, as it seemed, insulted the soldiers quartered
there. After repeated provocations, the tumult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
increasing, some of the soldiers fired, and killed four
of the lads, and apprehended some others. In an
instant the sedition spread through the whole town,
clamouring for the instant removal of the garrison,
with which the Deputy Governor and the commanding
officer were forced to comply, not only intimidated
by the actual riot, but receiving intelligence
that the neighbouring towns were taking up
arms, and would march to the assistance of the Bostonians,
who already imprisoned Colonel Preston,
who, they affirmed, had given orders to the soldiers
to fire. That he strenuously denied; and being a
man of a mild and prudent character, his case excited
great pity and indignation here. Nor, though
the seditious charged the military with sanguinary
intentions, was it credited; the soldiers, it appearing,
being so little prepared to attack, that when
they ran to the assistance of their comrades, some
were armed only with shovels, and others with
tongs. Volumes of inflammatory informations were
sent over hither and reprinted; and Alderman Trecothick
moved in the House of Commons for a sight
of the instructions sent to Boston, which, after some
debate, were granted with restrictions; but shortly
after came letters, in which the Bostonians endeavoured
to palliate their violence; and it was known
that Colonel Preston would not be tried till August,
which might and did give time to the more moderate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
there to soften his case, and interpose in his
favour. After a formidable suspense, he was honourably
acquitted.</p>

<p>On the 28th died Marshal Ligonier, aged ninety-two.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>
The first regiment of Guards was given to
the King’s brother, the Duke of Gloucester, and
the third to Lord Loudun. Lord Edgcumbe was
made Vice-Treasurer of Ireland, to the scandal
of the Rockingham party, the Duke of Portland
having resigned on the dismission of Lord Edgcumbe,
who, in truth, had long been too ready to
abandon that party, and at all times professed himself
too solicitous to keep or obtain a place; yet as
his old friends had joined Lord Chatham, who had
turned him out, he seemed as much at liberty to
take on with those whom Lord Chatham opposed.</p>

<p>Lord Chatham, in consequence of the notice he
had given, moved for a bill to rescind all the various
resolutions of the House of Commons on the Middlesex
election, and was supported by Lord Camden
and Lord Shelburne; Lord Mansfield and the Ministers
opposed and rejected the bill by 89 to 43.</p>

<p>The next day, Captain Boyle Walsingham, in
the Commons, moved for all the letters and papers
sent to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, which had
occasioned the prorogation of the Parliament there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
and had interrupted much business of consequence,—a
punishment the more severe, as the augmentation
demanded had been accorded. Grenville again
complained of his Majesty’s waiving his prerogative,
by promising not to call over those troops
but in case of rebellion,—a strange plea in an
opponent! but Grenville never liked opposition so
well as in <em>defence</em> of prerogative; while to excuse
his Majesty’s moderation, Lord Barrington
and Rigby maintained that, in case of emergency,
the King might disregard his promise,—a power
of evasion very unnecessary to claim, when it had
been so lately and so wantonly violated, merely
to give a pension to Dyson, though the Irish
had been promised that no more such pensions
on their country should be granted. The motion
was rejected by 178 to 66.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p>Lord Chatham made another prolix motion, tending
to censure the Ministers for the answer they
had advised the Crown to make to the remonstrance
from the City. His speech was long, animated
with his most nervous eloquence, and patchworked
with his wildest ignorance and inventions.
He talked of <em>Androgeus, Lord Mayor of London</em>
in the time of Julius Cæsar, defending the <em>privileges</em>
of the City, and of the care Edward the
First had of those liberties. Lord Gower told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
him that so much had been said, and such full
answers given by both Houses, (who had both,
indeed, approved the King’s answer,) on the Middlesex
election, that it would be tiring the House
to say more on that subject. The other Ministers
sat silent and would not be provoked to speak,
though loudly called on by Lord Shelburne, the
Duke of Richmond, Lord Lyttelton, and Lord
Temple. Lord Pomfret said a few words on the
factious behaviour of Beckford, who was defended
by Lord Shelburne:—“I shall always love him,”
said that Lord, “for, when the citizens murmured
at the King’s answer, as they quitted St. James’s,
the Lord Mayor bade them admire his Majesty’s
good humour, and told them the answer came
not from himself, but from his Ministers.” That
motion, too, was rejected by 85 to 37.</p>

<p>Those vague and unconcerted attacks wore out
the spirit of redress, instead of keeping up its
zeal. The several factions hated each other more
than they did their common enemies, and most
of the leaders of Opposition had, in their time,
contributed to the grievances of which they now
complained. It must, I think, appear evident,
from the scope of the reign, that the Princess
Dowager and Lord Bute had assumed the reins
with a fixed intention of raising the prerogative,
which they called restoring it to its ancient lustre;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
but nothing would have induced them to specify
at what period of its influence they would have
been contented to have stopped. The line of
Hanover having been advanced to the throne by
the forfeiture of the Stuarts, could not have the
confidence to demand all the power that had been
claimed by that House from which they descended,
whose maxims they secretly revered, and whose
want of abilities they inherited. King William
had been too much controlled by his parliaments
to serve them for a precedent; and the beginning
of this very reign had been too servilely copied
from the conclusion of Queen Anne’s, and too ingloriously
to be fit for quotation, though the doctrines
of her last Ministers were the rule on which
the junto had intended to act, and did act whenever
they found themselves strong enough. But,
as recent provocations govern the actions of men
more than maxims, it was the conduct of the later
Ministers of George the Second that first inspired
the Princess of Wales and her husband, Prince
Frederic, with desires of emancipating themselves
from such pupillage. I am persuaded that she,
her husband, and her son (if the latter at first
had any plan) meditated humbling the aristocracy,
rather than invading liberty. Yet is every increase
of prerogative so fatal, and so sure are the people
of being trampled upon in such contest, whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
the Crown or the nobility get the better, that
it was true patriotism to resist the attack, and
the people were in the right not to consider the
<em>motives</em> to the attempt, since in general questions
the privileges of all the subjects are equally concerned.
The truth of these observations will appear
from some remarks that I think it necessary
to make on a pamphlet which made much noise
at the time of which I am writing, and the effects
of which, though the treatise may be forgotten,
are felt at this day, <em>that</em> essay having operated
considerably towards dividing, and consequently
weakening the Opposition, which afterwards, by
accidents, deaths, treachery, self-interest, and mismanagement,
was reduced to the shadow of resistance,
and<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> was disabled from stemming that
torrent of intoxication, which, impelled by the
wicked arts of the Court, hurried even the people
into a passion for the American war, which, had
it prospered, would have demolished liberty, and
which, miscarrying, has destroyed the prosperity
and importance of Great Britain, and engendered
to the King’s comfort, more personal, though probably
but momentary influence to the Crown at
home, with a total degradation and loss of its
dignity everywhere else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
Let it be observed, however, that, when I impute
to the King and his mother little more than a
formed design of reducing the usurped authority
of the great Lords, I am far from meaning that
there were not deeper designs at bottom. Lord
Mansfield was by principle a tyrant; Lord Holland
was bred in a monarchic school, was cruel, revengeful,
daring, and subtle. Grenville, though in
principle a republican, was bold, proud, dictatorial,
and so self-willed that he would have expected
Liberty herself should be his first slave. The
Bedford faction, except the Duke himself, were
void of honour, honesty, and virtue; and the Scotch
were whatever their masters wished them to be,
and too envious of the English, and became too
much provoked by them, not to lend all their
mischievous abilities towards the ruin of a constitution,
whose benefits the English had imparted
to them, but did not like they should engross.
All these individuals or factions, I do not doubt,
accepted and fomented the disposition they found
predominant in the Cabinet, as they had severally
access to it; and the contradictions which the King
suffered in his ill-advised measures, riveted in him
a thirst of delivering himself from control, and to
be above control he must be absolute. Thus on
the innate desire of unbounded power in all princes,
was engrafted a hate to the freedom of the subject,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
and therefore, whether the King set out with a
plan of extending his prerogative, or adopted it,
his subsequent measures, as often as he had an
opportunity of directing them himself, tended to
the sole object of acting by his own will. Frequent
convulsions did that pursuit occasion, and
heavy mortifications to himself. On the nation
it heaped disgrace, and brought it to the brink
of ruin; and should the event be consonant to
the King’s wishes of establishing the royal authority
at home, it is more sure that the country
will be so lowered, that the Sovereign will become
as subject to the mandates of France, as
any little potentate in Europe.</p>

<p>This is my impartial opinion of the reign of
George the Third, from the death of his grandfather
to the end of the year 1771, when I wrote
these annals; and the subsequent transactions to
the commencement of the new Parliament in 1784
have but corroborated my ideas. I have spoken of
every party and faction favourably or unfavourably
as I thought they deserved, attached to no one of
them, for I saw faults in all: and that is all I mean
by calling myself impartial. My principles were
solely devoted to the liberty of my country; yet I
have censured even that liberty, when it degenerated
into licentiousness, or asserted its rights with
more probability of danger than success. That my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
impartiality was divested of personalities, nobody
would believe me if I asserted; they undoubtedly
often lowered my zeal, and even in these cool hours
of retreat and retirement, may have left impressions
that reflection may not have corrected—though the
overt acts of the American war have but too sadly
realized the more problematic suspicions I had
entertained of the evil designs of the Court, from
the first ten years of the reign. Lust of power,
supported by cruelty and obstinacy, marked every
year of that fatal war; and its woeful event having
corrected neither the bad intention nor the folly
with which it was commenced and prosecuted, and
a more undisguised attempt in the Crown of governing
independently having distinguished the year
1784, I should have observed the whole progress
of the reign hitherto with little judgment, if I had
not a worse opinion of the spirit that has actuated
it, than I had when I first entertained doubts of its
designs against the constitution. However, instead
of seeing with my eyes, I recommended to posterity
to use their own discernment, abandon the author,
accept what truths he has delivered, correct his
mistakes, condemn his prejudices, make the best
use you can of any wholesome lessons he has inculcated,
avoid such errors as he has pointed out. He
has written prodigiously too much, if no man shall
be the wiser for his writings. He laments not his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
pains, nor shall deprecate censure if a single person
becomes a real patriot, or a better citizen from
perusing this work—of which he himself is heartily
tired. Mr. Edmund Burke had published, on the
23rd of April, a long and laborious pamphlet, called
<i>Thoughts on the Present Discontents</i>. It was designed
for the manifesto of the Rockingham party,
stated their opinions, their political creed, the motives
of their opposition, the points for which they
meant to stickle, and the conduct they meant to
observe, if ever they should recover power. It was
a composition of great merit for ingenuity, eloquence,
and knowledge, though at once too diffuse,
and too refined: it tired the informed, and was
unintelligible to the ignorant. In point of judgment
it was totally defective, and did no honour to
the author, either as a virtuous statesman, or artful
politician. It had been often read to, and, they
said, discussed by, their party; but when the dictator,
and indeed legislator of the faction (for Lord
Rockingham was but a dignified phantom) had
so little judgment, it is not wonderful that the
blemishes of the work were not discerned by most
of his associates. Sir George Saville was too subtly
minute to comprehend a whole: Lord John Cavendish
loved general maxims; and though obstinate,
had no rancour; consequently, he approved the
book for not dealing in personalities. I was surprised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
that the Duke of Richmond, who had a great
deal of sense, could be captivated by a work calculated
for no one end but to deify Lord Rockingham,
and to insinuate that Mahomet<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> was his prophet.</p>

<p>Mrs. Macaulay, whose principles were more
sound and more fixed than Burke’s, and whose
reasoning was more simple and more exact, published
a short tract in answer, censuring the work
as compiled solely to serve the partial interests of
an aristocratic faction.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> It was a still stronger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
proof of its demerit, that the Court did not answer
it at all. Though some parts of it were very offensive,
yet the indemnity it bestowed on Lord Bute,
and the scandal it would give to the nation and to
every other faction, were so agreeable to the reigning
junto, that they wisely took no exception to
their own share, and left the rest to diffuse animosities
on every side. The work, as Mrs. Macaulay
said, avowed its patrons as an aristocratic faction;
and what was worse, confessed that they adhered
<em>to men</em> not <em>measures</em>: incredible as this folly was, it
may be seen in the book in so many words. It
insinuated the influence of the Princess, took no
notice of Lord Chatham, Lord Temple, Lord Camden,
or Mr. Grenville; disgusted the popular party<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
by dereliction of Wilkes, by disclaiming triennial
Parliaments and place-bills,<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> and encouraged no
denomination of men to unite with them, as it
declared in terms that should Lord Rockingham
and his friends come into place, they should do
little more than turn out those whom the book
called <i>the King’s men</i>, who called themselves <em>the
King’s friends</em>, and who, notwithstanding, the book
declared were never admitted to <em>the King’s confidence</em>.</p>

<p>But the most absurd part of all, was Burke’s
discharging Lord Bute of all present influence,—a
fact not only improbable, as had lately appeared by
the influence of his brother Mackenzie—by Lord
North’s taking Sir James Lowther’s steward for
his secretary, and by Sir James’s late hostilities to
the Duke of Grafton who had but half supported
him, and by his co-operation with Lord North—by
another clerk, whom Jenkinson had placed in Lord
North’s service, and who grew to govern him;<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> and
by the homage which all succeeding ministers were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
obliged to pay to the Bute-standard<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>, or to risk
their power: but it was extremely unwise in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
politic light, for while the book thus removed from
the people’s attention an odious and ostensible object,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
it presented them with nothing but a vague
idea, which it called <em>a Double Cabinet</em>. Did Burke
flatter himself that the Princess was so very sentimental,
as to forgive a personal attack on herself in
consideration of his tenderness to her favourite?
Would their tools be content to be proscribed, to
save their patron’s head? And who instructed, who
disciplined, Lord Bute’s creatures, but himself? If
the Princess was the intermediate agent between
them and the King, who conveyed his commands or
their advice from her to them, and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice versâ</i>, but
Lord Bute, Lady Bute, or Mr. Mackenzie? The
exculpation of Lord Bute was therefore silly and
impotent flattery, or sillier credulity instilled into
Burke by Lord Holland, who always held that
language.</p>

<p>Whether it proceeded from ignorance or partiality
I do not know, but in fathoming the grounds
of the reigning discontents, Mr. Burke was as defective
in not going back far enough, as he was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
the inefficiency of his remedies. Though his book
contained many melancholy truths, it was far from
probing to the bottom of the sore. The canker
had begun in the Administration of the Pelhams
and Lord Hardwicke, who, at the head of a proud
aristocracy of Whig Lords, had thought of nothing
but establishing their own power; and who, as it
suited their occasional purposes, now depressed and
insulted the Crown and Royal Family, and now
raised the prerogative. Their factious usurpations
and insolence were even some excuse for the
maxim taken up by Frederic Prince of Wales, by
the Princess Dowager, and the reigning King, of
breaking that overbearing combination; and so
blinded were the Pelhams by their own ambition,
that they furnished the Princess with men whose
principles and abilities were best suited to inspire
arbitrary notions into her son, and to instruct him
how to get rid of his tyrants, and establish a despotism
that may end in tyranny in his descendants.
Though the Princess and Lord Bute gave rashly
in to those views, their passions, folly, and cowardice
oftener defeated the plan than promoted it;
and it was in this light only that Lord Bute ought
to be acquitted of raising the prerogative. <em>He</em> rendered
it contemptible; while Stone and Murray
were the real sources of those discontents, which
Burke sought, but never discovered. As I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
said so much in the first part of these Memoirs on
these heads, it is unnecessary to retail them here.
A few facts will evince that the Pelhams, Hardwicke,
and their friends, were an aristocratic faction;
that they insulted and provoked the Crown and
Royal Family, and raised disgusts in them against
the Whig party, at the same time planting the
rankest Tories about the successor and his mother,
and forcing them to throw themselves into the
arms of even Jacobites.</p>

<p>1. When the late King intended to restore Lord
Granville, the Minister of his own election, the
Pelhams, leaguing with the great Lords and principal
Whigs, deserted him in the very heat of the rebellion,
and obliged him to surrender at discretion. What
a lesson was that to the late Prince!—no wonder it
laid him open to the wiles of Lord Bolingbroke!</p>

<p>2. Newcastle had long lain in the bosom of that
dark and suspected friend of the Stuarts, Andrew
Stone. The darling friend of the latter was that
bright ornament of the age, that luminary of the law,
that second hero of Pope and first disciple of Bolingbroke,
William Murray, brother of the Pretender’s
Prime Minister, the titular Earl of Dunbar. The
fickle Duke and his timid brother, of whom the
elder loved nothing so much as a new friend in a
reconciled enemy, as the younger with still less
sincerity courted every man whose parts he dreaded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
were easily persuaded to give themselves up to so
useful an assistant, whose walk interfered with the
ambition of neither. From that hour every measure
was coloured with a tincture of prerogative; and a
foundation was laid for that structure against which
the disciples of the Pelhams have so much declaimed
since.</p>

<p>3. While that dangerous man<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> was infusing his
poison into the Court of the King, his friend Lord
Bolingbroke was sowing the same seeds at Leicester
House. Seemingly attached to different factions,
St. John and Murray were carrying on the same
plan at both Courts. The death of the Prince, that
threatened destruction to the scheme, facilitated its
success. In truth had the advice of a man who has
since been no enemy to the plan been followed, the
principles instilled into a young mind might not
have been so early and so deeply laid. Mr. Fox,<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> the
very next morning after the death of the Prince of
Wales, advised Mr. Pelham to make sure of the
successor by sending for him to St. James’s, and
keeping him there separate from his mother. The
Princess, indeed, might not have secured the same
influence over him as she did; but from the persons
employed in the education of the young Prince,
there is little reason to think that exactly the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
care would not have been taken of initiating him in
<em>proper</em> principles. All Fox’s subsequent merits in
the cause—even the gracious promises made to him
by the young King, and broken, could not expiate
that offence.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></p>

<p>4. The persons employed, the books put into his
hands, the disgrace of the first governor and preceptor
of the young Prince, the interference of
Lord Mansfield, and the ensuing history of
Fawcett’s deposition of the Jacobitism of Stone
and Murray, the secrecy first exercised to stifle his
evidence, and the mock declaration of the Cabinet
Councillors when the affair got into the House of
Lords, where, instead of any examination, that ordeal
of an aristocracy, their word of honour, was only
made use of,—all these circumstances concurred in
the formation of those evils whose source Mr.
Burke so ingeniously missed.</p>

<p>5. The ignorance, blunders, and want of spirit
in Newcastle, Lord Anson, and Lord Hardwicke<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
the beginning of the war, made way for the predominant
genius of Mr. Pitt: but though the osier-like
nature of Newcastle stooped to act with the
latter again, the gloomy and revengeful temper of
Hardwicke waited for an opportunity of repaying
the disgrace Pitt had inflicted on their cabal. The
disgrace of his country was meditated, at least
effected, by Lord Hardwicke as revenge on Mr. Pitt.
The profusion of the German war (for which Mr.
Pitt only demanded supplies, but which he certainly
did not direct the Duke of Newcastle to suffer to be
plundered and perverted, though Pitt himself was
too ostentatiously or too carelessly profuse in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
demands) was laid solely to the account of the
vigorous Minister, as if it was more criminal in him
to dare, than in the other to dissipate our treasure
without daring. Even before the death of the late
King, was published the celebrated pamphlet called
“<i>Considerations on the German War</i>,” written under
the patronage and revisal of Lord Hardwicke. That
Lord Hardwicke and Lord Bute agreed about
that time, at least in their measures, for the
destruction of Mr. Pitt, was evident by a place
being, immediately on the King’s accession, bestowed
by Lord Bute on Mauduit, author of that
pamphlet.</p>

<p>6. Nor were these the sole instances of that
aristocratic spirit I have mentioned. The Duke of
Newcastle who in the very dawn of the Hanoverian
succession had forced himself, as godfather to his
son, upon the then Prince of Wales, in the next
reign set himself up as candidate for the Chancellorship
of Cambridge against the next Prince of Wales,
Frederic; and even caused the King to prohibit
the University to elect his son. Such were the
ideas a Whig aristocracy forced the Royal Family
to entertain of that party; as if the revolution had
been calculated to confirm the power of the nobility,
rather than to secure the constitution and the
liberty of the people.</p>

<p>7. The marriage act, schemed, drawn, and imposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
by Lord Hardwicke, repugnant to the principles
of a commercial country, and intended solely
to guard the wealth of the nobility from being dispersed
among their fellow citizens; the extension
of the Habeas Corpus prevented by Lord Mansfield;
and the murder of Admiral Byng<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> to palliate the
loss of Minorca, which had been sacrificed by the
negligence of Lord Anson and by the Duke of
Newcastle’s panic of an invasion, were all fruits of
the same spirit. Was it possible to review these
facts, and affirm that the principles of arbitrary
power were not sown till the present reign? The
Crown, indeed, got rid of the first authors of the
mischief; but then made advantage of the doctrines
they had established: for though a predominant
nobility often struggle with the Crown, the contest
is only which shall oppress the people, and they
as often abet the Crown in encroachments on liberty.
The number of members in the House of Commons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
named by great Lords, and the consequential dependence
of the Lower on the Upper House, facilitated
those views; and when once the resentment
and interest of the Court taught them to break the
Cabal, they made use of the power of those whom
they had interest or art enough to detach from the
faction.</p>

<p>8. On the death of the late King, the Princess,
Lord Bute, and their junto, provoked, as I have
said, by the great Whig Lords, whom they feared,
inclined to the Tories by the counsels of Bolingbroke,
Mansfield, and Stone, and disposed by the love of
power to endeavour to rise above the constitution,
had one capital view—the restoration of the prerogative;
and several secondary views, as the destruction
of Mr. Pitt, who possessed the hearts of the
people, the breaking of the aristocratic Cabal, and
the conclusion of a peace, without which they could
not have leisure, authority, or money to pursue their
other objects. Mr. Burke complained of the Duke
of Grafton, Mr. Conway, and other Whigs, for being
duped by the Court, and for deserting <i>their</i> connection;
but that mischief was done before these
came into place, and done by those whom Burke
would persuade the world were Whig patriots,
namely, Newcastle, Hardwicke, Devonshire,<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> &amp;c.
Mr. Pitt foresaw the turn the Court would take,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
and prudently proposed, it was affirmed, to the
Duke of Newcastle to league against Lord Bute;
and there can be no doubt of the truth of that
assertion, as Pitt would never again hear of any
connection with Newcastle. The Duke loved present
power and favour too well to listen to the
overture; and notorious it was that Newcastle,
Hardwicke, Devonshire, and the Duke of Bedford,
urged on by Lord Mansfield and Mr. Fox, did assist
the Favourite against Mr. Pitt, and combined to
drive him from the Administration. That was the
real breach that facilitated the views of the Court.
Newcastle, indeed, soon found his error, and was
the first sacrifice, as the Duke of Devonshire was
the next; while Stone and Mansfield, charmed to
see the era arrived that they had so ardently expected
and prepared, abandoned the silly Duke and
his still sillier associates, and remained fast friends
to the reviving prerogative. Then, <em>and not till then</em>,
the Whig Lords grew alarmed at the designs of the
Court. Lord Rockingham resigned with Newcastle;
and Devonshire was affronted and disgraced.
These last then thought the country grew seriously
in danger; but had Newcastle and his friends been
able to keep their places, I question whether we
should ever have heard <em>from them</em> of arbitrary
schemes, any more than of Mr. Burke’s pamphlet;
though I have no more doubt of the dangerous projects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
of the Court, than I believe Lord Rockingham’s
party likely, or capable to prevent them.</p>

<p>I shall say but little on the conclusion of a work
which prescribed unlimited voting with Lord Rockingham
and his friends as the test of <em>honesty</em>; while
at the same time, conscience is disclaimed, “<em>because</em>,”
says the book, “<em>no man can see into the heart of another</em>”—the
context of which curious doctrine is, that
it is more virtuous to follow another man, or other
men (into whose hearts neither can one see), than
to obey the impulse of one’s own conscience. Nothing,
or almost nothing, was promised to the Nation
by that faction, should they attain power; and
yet, with so scanty a catalogue of merits, they
claimed implicit confidence from all men! “<em>For</em>,”
says the author, “<em>can a man have sat long in Parliament
without seeing any one set of men whose character,
conduct, or disposition would lead him to associate
with them, and aid and be aided by them in any one
system of public utility</em>?”<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> I answer, if he is an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
honest man, it is impossible for him to have sat long
in Parliament, and not have seen through the selfish
or factious views of every set of men; and if he was
a sensible man, he must have seen the weakness and
insufficience of Lord Rockingham and his party.
But what shall we say, if this monkish obedience
was demanded, not only to this leader and his
leaders, but to a faction composed of men of the
most opposite and heterogeneous principles? Lord
Rockingham and his friends had adopted and joined
in measures concerted, proposed, imposed, now by
Lord Chatham, now by Mr. Grenville. Were Lord
Chatham’s system or principles, if he had either, the
same with Lord Rockingham’s? were Mr. Grenville’s?
If they were, why were they not of our
party? If they were not, why was any man bound
to vote with them? or when? Might Lord Rockingham
dissent from Lord Chatham or Mr. Grenville,
and might not another man dissent from them
too? or might such men dissent only when Lord
Rockingham did? What entitled Lord Rockingham
to be such a pope, such a rule of faith, such a
judge in the last resort? If Lord Chatham or Mr.
Grenville might sometimes be right, why might not
the Duke of Grafton or Lord North be so too?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
What enjoined a man to follow Lord Rockingham,
both when he agreed with Lord Chatham or Mr.
Grenville, and when he did not? The line of concord
and the line of discord should have been
marked out, and men should have been told what
were the principles, and what the objects of each
class. If they differed in principles, why did they
agree in measures? If they differed for power, how
could they ever agree? In the meantime was every
man’s conscience to be enslaved, till that blessed
moment should arrive in the fullness of time, when
Lord Rockingham should come with power and
glory to deliver the country by that one single act
and end of his mission, the turning out of the
King’s men?</p>

<p>Mr. Burke’s pamphlet having tended to nothing
but to the discredit of himself and his party, the
rest of the session produced little heat, and one
very commendable act of the Legislature. Mr.
George Onslow had brought in a bill (a tribute to
popularity) to take away the privilege of peers and
members of Parliament, except for their own persons,
so that they should no longer be able to screen
their houses and goods from their creditors, nor be
allowed to extend protection to their domestics.
The bill passed easily through the Commons, many
of the members who were inclined to oppose it,
trusting it would be rejected in the other House—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
Lords being less exposed to the consequences of
unpopularity, as their seats in Parliament are for
life: yet though many objections were made there,
Lord Mansfield undertook the support of the bill,
and it was passed, though Lord Egmont, with great
indignation at the diminution it occasioned in the
rights of peerage, and with bitter reflections on
Lord Mansfield, opposed it eagerly. The Duke of
Richmond, on the contrary, demanded to have the
indemnity of ambassadors retrenched likewise, urging
the scandalous conduct of Count Haslang, the
Bavarian Minister, who had for many years inhabited
a house without paying the rent, and would
not quit it, though the landlord had offered to remit
the whole debt, if the Count would but give up the
house. Lord Mansfield replied, that the privileges
of ambassadors depended on the law of nations.</p>

<p>I must take this opportunity of doing justice to
another instance of the Duke of Richmond’s virtues.
There had been a scheme the last year of making
a canal for carrying coals from Warwickshire to
Oxford, and thence to London. The members for
Newcastle, fearing it would lessen the demand for
their coal and hurt that nursery of seamen, acquainted
the Duke of Richmond, and desired his
concurrence in opposition to the plan, his Grace
being likely to suffer by it, as the grant to his
family from Charles the Second (producing to him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
an income of twelve thousand pounds a year), was
one shilling on every chaldron of coals entered in
the port of London. The Duke answered nobly,
that however detrimental the bill might be to his
interest, he would not oppose it, as it might lower
the price of coals to the poor.</p>

<p>The day before the Lords gave up their privileges,
they fined some printers for abusive papers
on different peers.</p>

<p>On May the 8th Alderman Trecothick moved the
other House for the instructions given to General
Gage, which, he affirmed, were repugnant to those
sent to our governors in America. This drew on
a long debate on American affairs; but the motion
was quashed, as were, next day, eight propositions
made by Mr. Burke, in a fine oration, tending
to censure Lord Hillsborough and the Administration
for their absurd and contradictory orders to
the Governors of the Colonies, to which variations
he imputed the troubles existing there. Wedderburne
and Lord North had a warm altercation,
in which each showed great abilities.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> Those resolutions,
which were strangely refined and obscure,
were again moved, but with no better success, in
the House of Lords, by the Duke of Richmond.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
It again did him honour, that, above joining in
the unjust violence of Opposition, his Grace made
an apology for Captain Preston. Lord Chatham,
who neither agreed with Mr. Grenville nor Lord
Rockingham on American questions, kept away
on these; but, thinking the Middlesex Election
more combustible matter, he and Beckford excited
the Common Council to address the King once
more on his answer to the remonstrance, which
on a division was agreed to, together with a resolution
to compliment Lord Chatham on his strenuous
defence of the rights of election. The same
day, he himself crudely made a motion in the
House of Lords for a dissolution of the Parliament.
He was answered by the Duke of Grafton, who
declared he would never more be connected in
business with Lord Chatham. The latter said that
declaration was unnecessary, as his own reason for
quitting power had been because he would no
longer serve with his Grace; adding, that he himself
desired never again to be in his Majesty’s
service. This was taken up with much ridicule,
the Ministers protesting they had never known
<em>till now</em> why his Lordship had resigned. Lord
Shelburne owned that the only ostensible reason
for dissolving the Parliament was the Middlesex
election. This Lord Egmont answered finely, and
said Lord Shelburne had <em>blabbed</em> what Lord Chatham<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
would not confess. The term <em>blabbed</em> exceedingly
offended Shelburne, who menaced the Ministers
on the disturbances he foretold would happen
in America and Ireland—the King’s promise to
which kingdom of not removing the troops he
treated as illegal. Lord Weymouth, observing that
Lord Camden had retired without staying to vote,
said artfully, the person who could have given
the best opinion on the question proposed, had
not chosen to take part in it with his friends,
or to stay to inform the House. The question
was rejected by 60 to 20.</p>

<p>This was the last parliamentary effort of the
session on the Middlesex election; very inadequate
to the flame with which it had commenced. Not
only the violence of the attack had prejudiced the
cause, but so divided were the factions in Opposition,
that their numbers were now diminished
to one half, while the Court party, conducted coolly
and rationally by Lord North, acted with some
firmness and some system. Yet, outrageous as the
assault had been on the House of Commons, and
arbitrarily and shamefully as the House had acted,
much good sprung indirectly out of the contention.
The scandal deservedly thrown on the members
for their corruption and servility, and their
dread of losing their future elections from their
unpopularity, made such impression on most of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
them, that, to compensate for their infamy, they
concurred in two most wholesome acts, which, perhaps,
no other moment could have wrung from
them; those were, Mr. Grenville’s law for trying
contested elections by select committees, and Mr.
Onslow’s for the restraint of privilege. The blow
to the peerage was permanent, who never lose their
seats, and indiscriminately useful to creditors against
members of Parliament. The less secure were the
extravagant, the fewer would be exposed to corruption
from necessity. It ought to be a standing
rule with the public to take all advantages of
forcing concessions and capitulations from the great,
when the complaisance of the latter is reduced
by interest or shame to court the people; and
the equivalent may often be preferable to the point
contended for, as well as more easily obtained.</p>

<p class="center b2">1770.</p>

<p>The King had scarce time to enjoy the favourable
conclusion of the session, before a new attack
was made on him. A remonstrance had been sent
from Newcastle, and, on May the 23rd, the second
remonstrance from the City of London was presented
by the Lord Mayor and Common Council.
It had been drawn up by Lord Chatham, or formed
on one of his late speeches. The King made a short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
and firm answer, referring to his former. He had
no sooner spoken it, than, to the astonishment of
the whole Court, Beckford, the Lord Mayor, desired
leave to say a few words. This was totally unprecedented.
Copies of all intended harangues to the
Sovereign are first transmitted privately to Court,
that the King may be prepared with his answer.
On this occasion, the King was totally at a loss
how to act. He was sitting in ceremony on his
throne, and had no means of consult, no time
to consider what to do. Remaining silent and
confounded, Beckford proceeded, with great expressions
of loyalty, and of assurances of the respect
and attachment borne to his Majesty by
the citizens, and he besought his Sovereign not
to listen to secret and malevolent insinuations
against them, and humbly solicited some favourable
syllable of reply. The King, however, made none,
but suffered them to kiss his hand, notwithstanding
the murmurs of the courtiers who surrounded him,
and who were scandalized at the innovation.</p>

<p>The citizens assembling three days afterwards to
consider of an address on the birth of a young
Princess, the Aldermen Harley and Rossiter loudly
censured the Lord Mayor for his novel address to
the King, uncommissioned by the City. It might
prevent his Majesty, they urged, from receiving their
addresses in the same state with which he received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
those from Parliament and the Universities,—a distinction
granted to no other corporation but to the
City of London; and might occasion a greater inconvenience,
for, as the maxim declares the King
can do no wrong, should a king on any similar
occasion answer improperly, it could not be imputed
to his Ministers. Beckford appealed to the
Common Council, who applauded his behaviour.
Wilkes, who had displeased his party by not attending
the remonstrance to St. James’s, and who had
been reproached as gained by the Court, pleaded
that he had not gone thither lest his presence
should give occasion to another massacre. He objected
to pay much compliment to the King on the
birth of his daughter, at a time when his Majesty
would lend no ear to the complaints of the City.
To the Queen, Wilkes said he had no objection to
their saying what they pleased. On the 30th, the
address was carried; but at Temple Bar the gates
were shut against the Aldermen by the people, who
concurred with Beckford and Wilkes in resenting
the King’s behaviour, and Harley was dragged out
of his chariot and escaped with difficulty: but by
order of the Lord Mayor the gates were opened,
and they proceeded to St. James’s, where, before
their admission to the King, the Lord Chamberlain
notified to Beckford that his late behaviour having
been unprecedented, his Majesty desired no such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
thing might happen again: to which Beckford, bowing,
replied, “To be sure not.” They were then
admitted to the presence; and though the address
was colder than usual, the King told them that
while their addresses were so loyal, the City should
be sure of his protection.</p>

<p>This was the last public incident in the life of
William Beckford, Lord Mayor of London, he
dying three weeks afterwards of a violent fever,
contracted, as supposed, from the agitation into
which his violence had thrown his blood, and from
sudden cold caught in the country, whither he had
retired for a little repose. He died on the 21st of
June, aged sixty-two. He had boldness, promptness,
spirit, a heap of confused knowledge, displayed
with the usual ostentation of his temper, and so
uncorrected by judgment, that his absurdities were
made but more conspicuous by his vanity. Under
a jovial style of good humour, he was tyrannic in
Jamaica his native country, and under an appearance
of prodigality, interested. On the other side,
the excesses of his factious behaviour were founded
neither on principle nor on rancour. Vain glory
seemed to be the real motive of all his actions.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
His death was one of the heaviest blows Lord
Chatham could receive, cutting off all his influence
in the City; and it was another cause of the
Opposition’s ensuing humiliation, the turbulence
of Beckford, his imposing noise, and his great
wealth, concurring to his authority. His successors
in the party were utterly contemptible, except
Trecothick, who was a decent man. This last was
chosen Mayor for the rest of the year. A statue
was voted to Beckford’s memory, and ordered to be
placed in Guildhall, with the words he had ventured
to speak to the King engraven on the pedestal,—so
strong was the party as yet in the City.
Lord Chatham, the day before Beckford’s death,
forced himself into his house, and got away all the
letters he had written to that demagogue.</p>

<p>The celebrated Junius alone kept up the flame of
opposition with any show of parts; but having at
this time satirized the King, even for his private
virtues, it did but throw discredit on the author.
Almon, the printer, was now tried for selling Junius’s
former Address to his Majesty; and though
he pleaded that the copies had been left at his shop
and sold by his servant without his knowledge, the
judge told the jury that a master was answerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
for his servant; and they found Almon guilty.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a>
This man was reckoned to have made a fortune
of 10,000<i>l.</i> by publishing and selling libels. Woodfall,
the original publisher of Junius’s Address,
escaped better, being found <em>guilty of printing and
publishing only</em>, though Lord Mansfield, who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
likewise tried Almon, endeavoured by the most
arbitrary constructions to mislead the jury, telling
them that they had nothing to do with the <em>intention</em>,
nor with the other words in the indictment, as
<em>malicious</em>, <em>seditious</em>, &amp;c., which he affirmed were only
words of course; and which yet would have fallen
heavily on the accused, had the jury paid regard
to such abominable doctrine. The despotic and
Jesuitic Judge went farther: he said, the business
of the jury was to consider whether the blanks were
properly filled up; as to the contents of the paper,
whether true or false, they were totally immaterial—no
wonder juries were favourable to libellers,
when the option lay between encouraging abuse,
and torturing law to severe tyranny! It did the
jury honour that they preferred liberty to the voice
of the inquisitor. Not content with open violations
of justice, he carried the jurors home with him—though
without effect.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> Nor was his management
of the two trials less wicked. He had selected
Almon for the first sacrifice, though only a second
publisher, before Woodfall, the original editor, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
Woodfall being an inhabitant of the City of
London, the Chief Justice had little hope of influencing
a Middlesex jury: but Almon residing in
Westminster, was more likely to be convicted: in
which case it would be more difficult for the jury to
absolve the original publisher, when even his copyist
had been condemned—a shameful wile, for
which the Attorney-General could not help making
an apology! Almon tried to obtain a revision of
his sentence, but Lord Mansfield put it off, till he
should see the event of Woodfall’s trial. When
the latter’s sentence was pronounced, this second
Jefferies insisted that the jury should swear they
thought him guilty of <em>publishing only</em>,—an inquisition
unprecedented, unheard of! To impose new
oaths on a jury! and after sentence! and after they
had been dissolved! What criminal could be more
heinously guilty than such a judge? Miller and
Baldwin, two other printers, were brought in not
guilty for the very same crime for which Almon
was condemned—probably from the indignation
conceived at Lord Mansfield’s illegal conduct.</p>

<p>Lord Holland now returned to England in a
weak state, which he affected to represent as more
deplorable than it was, confining himself to his
house, from which he stirred no more. The embassy
of the Comte du Châtelet being expired, he
returned home, and was replaced by the Comte de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
Guines,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> a man of less abilities, but very grateful
to this country from the decency and fairness of his
behaviour.</p>

<p>Another journey excited uncommon curiosity.
The Princess Dowager of Wales, after an uninterrupted
residence of thirty-four years in this country,
and after having secluded herself in a manner from
the world during the last nine years, set out for
Germany, under pretence of visiting her brother, the
Duke of Saxe Gotha, and her daughters, the Queen
of Denmark, and the Princess of Brunswick. As
mystery and policy were imputed to all her actions,
her declarations were not believed, merely because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
<em>she</em> made them. The people concluded she went to
meet Lord Bute; others expected that some stroke
would be struck during her absence to which she
might plead not having been privy. As she carried
the Duke of Gloucester with her, some believed
that it was a trial to break his connection with
Lady Waldegrave: some that she was displeased
at the increasing power of the Queen: and a few,
though perhaps not the worst guessers, that she
went to secure her wealth in Germany. That the
Princess of Brunswick was included in the motives
of that journey is most probable. It was settled that
the Princess and her husband, the hereditary Prince,
should come to England the next year; and it is as
certain that the Queen prevailed on the King to
forbid their coming. The Princess of Wales, who
had so cordially hated both her daughter and son-in-law,
had taken much affection to them, not only
from the court they paid to her, but from the use
she found in her daughter. The Princess Dowager
having lost much of her influence over the King,
was often refused favours that she asked of him.
This her haughty spirit could not brook. Princess
Augusta had no such reserve. Her intimacy coeval
with the King had given her entire familiarity with
him! and she would take no denials: her mother
employed her in teazing the King till he granted
whatever she asked. The ease and gaiety of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
Princess Dowager during her residence abroad,
showed how much share her unpopularity, fear, and
sullen pride had in her recluse system,—fear, not
without cause: as she passed through Canterbury
she was hissed and insulted—yet at Dover she met
with no affronts; nor were there any illuminations
or bonfires in London for joy of her departure, as
had been expected. She had a slight interview with
her daughter of Denmark, an extraordinary Princess!
Christian the Seventh had conceived an instantaneous
aversion to her on their marriage; and had even disgraced
his favourite cousin, the Prince of Hesse, for
taking her part. While her husband was in England,
the Russian Minister treated her disrespectfully;
but though the Czarina governed the Danish
King, the Queen with proper spirit commanded the
insolent foreigner to quit the kingdom. Her resolution
continued after her husband’s return; and
at last gained the ascendant. Bernsdorffe, Prime
Minister and creature of Russia, was disgraced; so
was young Holke, the King’s favourite. Thus far
her Majesty acted with reputation; but when the
public beheld the King’s physician engross all
favour, and when that physician seemed equally
dear to both King and Queen, the wildest conjectures
were let loose. Certain it is that the Queen
showed a lofty spirit as well as singular manners.
She was grown to an enormous fatness; yet when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
she met her mother on the frontiers, she was accoutred
in a man’s habit with breeches of buckskin:
and when the Princess of Wales lamented the disgrace
of Bernsdorffe, the ancient Minister of the
family, the Queen of Denmark said abruptly, “Pray,
Madam, let me govern my own kingdom as I please.”</p>

<p>During the absence of her Royal Highness was
decided, against her youngest son the Duke of Cumberland,
the suit for adultery with a young woman
of quality, whom a good person, moderate beauty,
no understanding, and excessive vanity had rendered
too accessible to the attentions of a Prince of the
Blood. Their letters were produced at the trial, and
never was the public regaled with a collection of
greater folly! Yet to the lady’s honour be it said,
that, bating a few oaths, which sounded more
masculine than tender, the advantage in grammar,
spelling, and style was all in her favour. His Royal
Highness’s diction and learning scarce exceeded
that of a cabin-boy, as those eloquent epistles,
existing in print, may testify. Some being penned
on board of ship were literal verification of Lord
Dorset’s <span class="locked">ballad,—</span></p>

</div>

<p class="in0">Grievous censure fell on his governor and preceptor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
Mr. Legrand and Mr. Charles, and not less on the
Princess herself, so totally had his education been
neglected. He had been locked up with his brother,
the Duke of Gloucester, till the age of twenty-one,
and thence had sallied into a life of brothels and
drunkenness, whence the decency of the elder,
and his early connection with Lady Waldegrave,
preserved the Duke of Gloucester. The younger
was pert, insolent, senseless, and not unwillingly
brutal. So little care taken of a Prince of the
Blood did but confirm the opinion of the public, that
the plan of the Princess, Lord Bute, and the King
had been to keep down and discredit the King’s
brothers as much as possible. The Duke of Cumberland,
at least, did not disappoint the scheme, as
will hereafter appear. As a dozen years afterwards
it was evident that no greater care, though with
still more rigorous confinement, had been taken of
the morals and style of the Prince of Wales, who
issued from that palace of supposed purity, the
Queen’s house, as if he had been educated in a
night-cellar, it gave but too much ground for suspecting
that, undeterred by what had happened to
his brother, the jealousy of his heir had not been
less predominant in the King than it had been in
the neglect of his brothers.</p>

<p>Other trials of note there were at that time.
Lord Chatham lost a cause against one of Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
William Pynsent’s relations to the value of 15,000<i>l</i>,
a sum he could ill spare after his ungovernable
waste, and which but sharpened his appetite for
recovery of power.</p>

<p>A criminal trial made more noise. Two Kennedys,
young Irishmen, had been charged with, and
one of them had been condemned for, the murder
of a watchman in a drunken riot. They had a
handsome sister, who was kept by two young men
of quality. Out of friendship to them, Mr. George
Selwyn had prevailed on six or seven of the jury
to make an affidavit that, if some circumstances,
which had really been neglected by the counsel
for the prisoners, had appeared on the trial, they
would not have brought in their verdict murder.
Mr. Selwyn applied for mercy, and the young convict
was reprieved; but when the report was made
in Council, Lord Mansfield prevailed to have him
ordered for execution. Mr. Selwyn, whose constant
flow of exquisite wit made him generally
acceptable, applied in person to the King, and
represented that Lord Rochford, the Secretary of
State, had under his hand assured the pardon; that
such an act had always been deemed pardon, and
that the prisoner had been made acquainted with
it. The King immediately renewed his promise,
the criminal was ordered for transportation, and
was actually on board the vessel bound for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
plantations, when Horne, the clergyman, and other
discontented persons complained of the pardon, and
not only complained of it to blacken the King, but,
horrible spirit of faction! instigated the watchman’s
widow to appeal against it, which, if sentence
should again follow, would bar all pardon; nor
could the King do more than reprieve from time
to time. The woman did prosecute; and the young
man was again remanded to his gaol and terrors,
a second punishment, unjustly inflicted; for, though
probably guilty, he had satisfied the law. Nothing,
however, being more difficult than to effectuate
such appeal, errors were continually found, the prisoner
was remanded to prison as often as brought
to trial, and the widow at last yielded to a compensation,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a>
notwithstanding the unwearied endeavours
of the merciless priest. That turbulent divine
was soon afterwards found guilty himself of
defaming Mr. Onslow, and fined 500<i>l.</i> He was
one of the principal incendiaries and promoter of
all libels, and, in truth, their excess was shocking,
and in nothing more condemnable than in the
dangers they brought on the liberty of the press,
which it was difficult for its warmest friend to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
defend. It was in every man’s mouth, that the
evil was grown past sufferance. Every man trembled,
expecting, what almost every man experienced,
abuse. The good name, the credit, the character
of all were at the mercy of anonymous malice
and a mercenary printer. The universal language,
that abuse was too general to be regarded,
was not an adequate answer. Abuse spreads further
than vindication, nor does it even die by
neglect; it takes root in the country and makes
lasting impressions. Two answers, indeed, there
were; first, the difficulty of drawing the line. Ministers
are and ought to be lawful game, yet the
law could not except them as proper to be abused.
The other was the spirit of the Court, which aimed
at despotism, and the daring attempts of Lord
Mansfield to stifle the liberty of the press, without
authority of the law, and without any new restrictions
made by the legislature. He had, indeed,
effected an aggravation of the excess, for his innovations
had given such an alarm, that scarce a jury
would find the rankest satire libellous; and that indemnity
encouraged the printers to go to the most
envenomed and unwarrantable lengths, of which, to
prove my impartiality, I will quote some flagrant
examples. I have mentioned the embittered licentiousness
of Junius, particularly on the Dukes of
Bedford and Grafton, reproached with misfortunes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
in their families. Another paper, containing severe
reflections on the latter Duke, was published, affecting
to be written by the Duke of Richmond. A
second paper, attributed, in like manner, to the
Duke of Grafton, threatened to kick the Duke
of Richmond,—infamous, though unsuccessful attempts
to excite a duel between those adverse
lords!</p>

<p>The other instance, of a blacker, because of a
more extensive dye, as it might have proved, was
at least distinguished by the novelty and singularity
of its humour. It was a very ludicrous and
ironic satire on the King of Spain, though many
of the facts were borrowed or by mistake adapted
to him from his mad brother, the late King Ferdinand.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a>
A second letter was promised on the
King of France; but three French officers went
to the printer and stopped it, by vowing they
would murder him, if any invective against their
master should appear. Some Spaniards were disposed
to execute what the French had threatened,
but were with difficulty prevented by their Ambassador,
the Prince of Masserano, who told them
they would infallibly be hanged. They said they
could not die in a better cause. That Prince was
inexpressibly hurt, and told our Ministers he did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
not know how to write the account to his Court;
he wished the insult might not cause a war. This
attempt was the more flagitious, by being calculated
to blow into a flame a quarrel of a serious
nature then in agitation between the two Courts.
Despairing faction grounded its last hopes on blood
and a rupture between the two nations.</p>

<p>In the account of Lord Anson’s voyage round
the world, there is dropped a hint that a settlement
in the South Sea would be of great advantage
to England in time of war. Lord Egmont,
when at the head of the Admiralty, had adopted
that idea, and caused possession to be taken for us
of one of the Falkland Islands, a desolate rock near
the straits of Magellan. According to the received
code of European usurpation, prior occupancy or
discovery implies right. To have taken nominal
possession of another country, not before known
to any of us invaders, constitutes property among
Christian potentates, or robbers, and by that piratic
jurisprudence, the Falkland Islands belonged
to, though abandoned by, Spain. Our breach of this
iniquitous seniority of claim was highly resented
by the King of Spain, personally a hater of England
ever since he had trembled before our navies,
when only King of Naples, and had been humbled
in the last war. The Governor of Buenos Ayres,
within whose district lay the desert in question,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
was ordered (underhand) to dispossess us, and did.
That intention had been known to our Administration
some months before the Duke of Grafton
quitted the reins; but, according to his custom, he
had neglected the notice, or, with equal indifference,
had intended to slubber over the quarrel in tame
conferences with the Spanish ambassador here;
and there the affair had dozed, till the “Favourite”
sloop, arriving in the month of June, brought advice
that our colony had been expelled from the island,
and, by rousing the nation, awakened the Administration.
Whether we had been the aggressors
or not, was not a consideration to have weight
with the people, much less with Opposition. Nothing
was in the mouths of either but the insult;
and whatever the Ministers thought, or whatever
they proposed to bear, it was not openly that they
dared to talk any language but war, or at least
resentment. Orders were given to fit out fleets
and to impress men, and a messenger set off for
Madrid to demand immediate restitution of the
island. The answer was very indefinite, and too
unsatisfactory to bear publication. A categoric
answer was then said to be demanded, but no
such answer arrived. France talked peace; her
finances were greatly in disorder; we trusted to
their language or their situation; Spain behaved
as depending on their support, or as resolved to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
extort it; but I must not too much anticipate
events. A fire in the magazines at Portsmouth,
to a considerable amount, and the authors of which
were not discovered, was imputed rather to our
friends the French than to Spain our enemy, and
looked like a return for a discovery the former
had made of some such design from hence. A
young Irish officer of some birth, Gordon by name,
who had fled for a duel, had been beheaded at
Brest, and had been proved to have been in the
pay of our Ambassador, Lord Harcourt.</p>

<p>Wilkes still kept up a flame: he was chosen
Master of the Joiner’s Company, procured a remonstrance
from the county of Surrey, and Richard
Oliver, an unknown young citizen, but a member of
the Bill of Rights, was chosen unanimously to
represent the City of London in the room of Beckford.
Eyre, the Recorder, an able man and spirited,
offended the City by refusing to attend their remonstrance,
which he affirmed was a libel. All the
prejudice they could do to him was to refuse to consult
him on points of law, by which he lost about
200<i>l.</i> a year.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> They had a longer contest with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
Adams, Scottish brethren and architects, who had
bought Durham Yard, and erected a large pile of
building with dwellings and warehouses, under the
affected name of the Adelphi. These men, of great
taste in their profession, were attached particularly
to Lord Bute and Lord Mansfield, and thus by
public and private nationality, zealous politicians.
The citizens, on whose rights over the river they
had encroached, went to law with them, and applied
to Parliament, where Court partiality on one side,
and party malice on the other, considered nothing
but their several prejudices: the influence of the
Crown decided, accordingly, in favour of the Adams.
But the circumstance which makes that contest
history, was, its giving date to a new subdivision of
factions. Debates for and against the Adams had
run very high amongst the Aldermen and Common
Council. Their speeches, or rather their personal
abuse, were printed in the public parades with the
parade of Parliamentary orations. Alderman Harley
said, he rejoiced at any disgrace that fell on the
City; and that the Aldermen had been very indulgent
to suffer Wilkes to stand candidate for the
City when he was outlawed. Wilkes with equal
modesty replied, that in so doing they had acted
very illegally. But the person who took the lead
in those wrangles was Alderman Townshend, the
agent of Lord Shelburne, who, it now came out,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
was tampering to wrest the City out of Wilkes’s
hands. He had even gained over Parson Horne,
the publisher of those vulgar debates; and who, to
serve his new friends, constantly gave the advantage
to Townshend over Wilkes,—sources of a
quarrel that blazed much higher afterwards, and
ruined the Opposition in the City.</p>

<p>The Court, as if to balance the advantages they
reaped by the feuds in the Opposition, gave a new
handle to clamour by raising their desperate tool,
Colonel Lutterell, to be Adjutant-General in Ireland,
obliging Colonel Cunningham, who had distinguished
himself by restoring the discipline and
model of the Irish army, to exchange that post for
a government which they forced from Colonel
Gisburne for a large pension, and the promise of
the next good government. Cunningham abandoned
them the next year in their distress. The
gratitude of the Lutterells was of another kind,
and will have its place.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> The Middlesex election
was still the favourite grievance. A meeting of
the freeholders of Yorkshire was advertized, in
order to remonstrate, for the 26th of August, but
the High Sheriff refused to summon the county;
on which Lord John Cavendish and twenty-seven
more, advertized a meeting for the 25th of September.
When that day arrived, Charles Turner proposed
a new remonstrance; but to the surprise of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
the most zealous, Sir George Saville talked with
much moderation; and Lord John occasioned
greater astonishment by advising the assembly to
expect, by decency, redress from the King. The
assembly, not knowing how to decipher that change
of language, broke up perplexed, and content with
thanking their representatives, Sir George Saville
and Lascelles.</p>

<p>The key to this mystery, never publicly divulged,
was, that Lord Mansfield had opened a negotiation
with Lord Rockingham, whose aunt he had married,
and the Court had offered to make sacrifices of two
or three of its most specious friends: but as the
Marquis, who had come to town on purpose to conclude
the bargain, found it by no means intended
to reinstate him in the first place, the treaty broke
off, after the leaders had shown how ready both
sides were to give up their second-rate friends.</p>

<p>While discord and interest thus tore in pieces
the Opposition, fate was preparing to deprive them
of their most important centurians. Beckford was
already gone. The next was the Marquis of
Granby, the idol of the army and of the populace.
He died at Scarborough, October 20th: in so few
months did Lord Chatham lose his tribune and his
General, and was reduced to his ill-content friend,
Chancellor Camden, his ill-connected brother, Lord
Temple, and his worse-reconciled brother, Mr. Grenville!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
Were there any reality in the idea that noble
blood diffuses an air of superior excellence over the
outward form, and refines the qualities of the mind;
and were that idea not refuted by the majority of
examples to the contrary, Lord Granby would have
appeared a shining instance of both effects. His
large and open countenance, its manly and pure
colours glowing with health, his robust and commanding
person, and a proportion of florid beauty so
great, that the baldness of his head, which he
carried totally bare, was rather an addition to its
comely roundness than a defect, and a singularity
more than an affectation,—all distinguished him
without any extrinsic ornament, and pointed out
his rank when he walked without attendance, and
was mixed with the lowest people, who followed
him to beg his charity, or to bless him for it. His
mind was as rich in the qualities that became his
elevated situation. Intrepidity, sincerity, humanity,
and generosity, were not only innate in his breast,
but were never corrupted there. His courage and
his tenderness were never disunited. He was dauntless
on every occasion, but when it was necessary to
surmount his bashfulness. His nerves trembled like
a woman’s, when it was requisite that he should
speak in public. His modesty was incapable of
ostentation.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> His rank, his services, and the idolatry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
of the people could inspire him with no pride,—a
sensation his nature knew not. Of money he
seemed to conceive no use but in giving it away:
but that profusion was so indiscriminate, that compassion
or solicitation, and consequently imposture,
were equally the masters of his purse. Thus his
benevolence checked itself, and wasted on unworthy
objects the sums he often wanted to bestow on real
distress.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> Nor was it less fatal to his own honour,
but plunged him in difficulties from which some
discretion in his bounty would have secured him.
As his understanding was by no means proportioned
to his virtues, he was always obnoxious to the interested
designs of those who governed him; and
between his own want of judgment and the ascendant
of those who hampered him in their toils, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
supplying his necessities with money at exorbitant
interest, he was bought and sold by successive
Administrations and different parties; and generally,
when the former fell, he abandoned those he had
attached himself and been obliged to, and lent
himself to measures which his principles disapproved,
and then reverted to those principles
against his inclination. No man meant to feel
more patriotism, or to be more warmly attached to
the constitution of his country; yet his unsuspicious
nature suffered him to be easily made the tool of
its enemies; and when he sacrificed his darling
command of the army in a convulsion of integrity,
he neither acted with grace nor firmness, nor
showed a knowledge of the question for which he
devoted himself, nor made the stand so soon as he
ought to have done; and, what was worse, he was
forced upon the step he took unwillingly by a man<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a>
who had not the reputation of common honesty, or
pretended to be actuated by any principle but self-interest
and revenge.</p>

<p>In an age more simple, Lord Granby had been a
perfect hero. In a rude age he would probably
have been a successful general from his own valour,
and the enthusiasm of attachment which his soldiers
felt for him; but in times wherein military knowledge
is so much improved, it was perhaps fortunate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
for his country that the sole command was never
entrusted to him on any capital emergency. Yet
they must have been the many solid virtues which
he possessed, that could make him so greatly respected
in a corrupt age, when talents are more
esteemed than merit, or when hypocrisy alone
runs away with the character and rewards of virtue.</p>

<p>His domestic qualities were all of the amiable
kind. His only remarkable vice proved fatal to
him: his constant excesses in wine inflamed his
sanguine complexion, hurrying him out of the world
at forty-nine!</p>

<p>The regiment of Blue Guards, vacant by Lord
Granby’s death, was immediately given to General
Conway. Lord Holland, when acting Minister in
the House of Commons, had carried a positive
promise of that regiment, on the first vacancy,
to the Duke of Richmond. The Duke, who did
not expect that engagement would be kept to
him, now in earnest opposition, wrote an artfully
handsome letter to the King to release him from
that promise; but his Majesty had violated it before
he received the Duke’s dispensation, and made no
answer.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> The Duke was not less hurt at Conway’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
accepting the place, knowing it had been promised
to his Grace. Conway pleaded having had no notion
that the Duke thought of it, now he was so fixed in
opposition. The Duke owned he had not expected it;
but asked Conway a distressing question,—whether
he had had more friendship for Lord Granby, for
whose sake he would not accept the Ordnance,
which Lord Granby had resigned, than for him, who
was his son-in-law and intimate friend; yet Lord
Granby had resigned it, which made a difference—and
Conway, who was fonder of applause than
money, thought it would be popular to refuse Lord
Granby’s spoils. The King was probably not sorry
to occasion a jealousy between the Duke and Conway;
but I reconciled them. The Duke for years
resented the King’s breach of his word; and though
he paid his duty to the Queen, he constantly left the
drawing-room without approaching the King. The
fluctuation of parties in 1783 and 1784 brought
them together again; but though the Duke grew a
zealous courtier, contrary to his many warm declarations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
the King, who had given the offence, was not
so cordially reconciled; and though he always embraced
an enemy to expose him, his alacrity was as
great in sacrificing him on the first opportunity.</p>

<p>On the 27th of October, the Princess of Wales
and the Duke of Gloucester returned from Germany.
They travelled all night and arrived very
early in London, to prevent her Royal Highness
receiving any insults from the populace.</p>

<p>The preparatives for war and the want of men
occasioned orders being given for pressing. Wilkes,
as the patron of liberty, declared against that practice
as illegal; and, as sitting Alderman, dismissed
a man who had been impressed within the liberties
of the City. Sawbridge did the like; yet the latter
was by no means attached to Wilkes, nor led by
him. The strictness of Sawbridge’s principles and
the insinuations of his comrade Townshend, had
made him look with aversion on the profligacy of
Wilkes. They publicly disagreed at a numerous
and tumultuous meeting of the lowest inhabitants
of Westminster, assembled by invitation in the Hall,
where Wilkes read a Paper to them calculated to
promote an impeachment of Lord North for the
neglect of the Falkland Islands, for advising the
measures taken on the Middlesex election, and for
the contempt into which the nation was fallen with
foreign countries. The paper recommended to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
advise his Majesty to remove all his Ministers,
particularly Lord Mansfield, and to admit no Scot
into Administration. It proposed laws for empowering
electors to choose any man without regard to
any sentence passed on him for any crime whatsoever;
and for prohibiting general warrants being
issued, even for recruiting the army and navy; and
other laws to allow an additional witness to be
brought to convict a man, though acquitted by a
jury or pardoned by a Court! The extravagant
injustice and folly of the two last propositions, and
the latitude and impracticability of the rest, wore
evident marks of absurdity and despair: and the
three first heads could by no means be applicable
to Lord North, the two first having happened in
the Duke of Grafton’s Administration; and the
contempt conceived for us by foreigners being the
result of Lord Bute’s peace, of the distracted and
fluctuating counsels of the Court, and of repeated
changes of contradictory Administrations. One
More then called out, desiring to have the paper
read again, most of the audience, he said, not having
heard distinctly the particulars, and being averse
to vote for what they had not heard. Having a
loud voice, More himself was desired to read the
paper, which he did, and disputed with Wilkes on
many articles of it. Sawbridge, too, opposed the
insertion of the contents into a memorial, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
in so venal a Parliament Lord North would be sure
of an acquittal, which would only do him service
(and in truth it was evident that Lord North
was only attacked as Minister for the time being).
Sawbridge therefore proposed another remonstrance
to the King, which was agreed, and was confined
almost to the Middlesex election. It was signed
by Wilkes as chairman of the assembly, and presented
to the King on the 7th of November by
Sir Robert Bernard, who would not kneel when
he delivered it. Wilkes published an enthusiastic
account of the above meeting, professing he
believed that the voice of the people was the voice
of God.</p>

<p>This unprosperous state of the Opposition was
very favourable to the Ministry, especially to Lord
North, who wished to avoid a war with Spain; nor
was the unprejudiced part of the nation at all eager
for war. The Rockingham party called for it to
embarrass the Government, and the patriots in the
City meant to clog the operations of it. In this
situation no answer being arrived from Spain, and
the Session of Parliament being ready to open, it
seemed extraordinary that Lord North, possessed of
so much power, did not put off the meeting, which
was fixed for the 13th of November, as it was
possible a definitive answer might arrive on the
10th, and leave but three days to determine on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
peace or war.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> Lord North said he had two
speeches ready for the King, either a martial or a
pacific one—but was that a justification? or indeed
was it prudent to leave so little time for option?
The fact, I believe, was, that he was duped both at
home and abroad. Francés, the French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Chargé-d’affaires</i>,
persuaded him that the Duc de Choiseul
was intensely bent on preserving peace—a point
on which I shall say more hereafter. On the other
hand, the most mysterious, and indeed suspicious,
conduct was held by Lord Weymouth and his governor
Wood, who communicated as little as possible
of the negotiation to Lord North. This conduct
requires both a detail and a comment.</p>

<p>Not only to Lord North was Lord Weymouth
reserved and incommunicative; not only to Francés
would he give no opening; but to Robert Walpole,
Secretary to the Embassy at Paris (whence Lord
Harcourt was absent), his dispatches were so mysterious
and inexplicit, that Thomas Walpole advised
his brother to send them back, or come away.
Every letter began with directions not to admit
the French as <em>mediators</em>, but only as friends. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
was proper; but the caution was so great and the
repetitions so frequent, that it looked more like
fear of the letters being called for by Parliament,
than dignity inspired by national honour. It was
understood so little in the latter light by the Duc
de Choiseul, that he said to Thomas Walpole, then
at Paris, “<span class="lote" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Milord Weymouth ne parle point, et
Milord Rochfort parle trop.</span>” The latter was a
weak man, zealous against France, and obnoxious to
Choiseul, who, made impatient by Lord Weymouth’s
dilatory darkness, and apprised of Lord North’s
pacific disposition, said at last to Robert Walpole,
“<span class="lote" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Votre Ministère ne veut pas faire la guerre, et ne
sait pas faire la paix.</span>” Wood came under bad
suspicions, and, I believe, very deservedly, on this
enigmatic conduct, to which many motives concurred.
His ideas were by no means ready, though
in writing he had the art of elucidating them beautifully.
He was full of guile, dark, and interested.
His patrons, Lord Weymouth and Lord Gower,
were impatient to overturn Lord North, and share
or scramble for his power; and Wood, though willing
to promote their views, had certainly a farther
view of his own. He was impressed with a notion
that war with Spain was unavoidable; and concluded
that his ancient master, Lord Chatham,
would be called out by the nation to manage that
war—at least, on the first check given to our arms.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
This he inadvertently dropped; and the irregularities
of Lord Weymouth’s subsequent conduct confirmed
the opinion that Wood was not unwilling to
purchase his pardon of Lord Chatham, by the sacrifice
of Lord North, and by the treachery of Lord
Weymouth. Nor was this the most culpable part
of Wood’s conduct. Francés, who trafficked deeply
in our stocks, as they fluctuated during the vicissitudes
of the negotiation, discovered Wood in the
same path, and playing with the transactions as it
suited his moneyed views. This Francés communicated
to many, and, I believe, to Lord North, of
whose honour he spoke highly, and vaunting that
he himself could conclude the peace in a day’s time,
if not traversed by Wood; for whatever were Choiseul’s
views, Francés acted with seeming passion for
pushing on the negotiation. France was, indeed, ill
prepared for war. The very war which Choiseul
had conjured up between Russia and Constantinople
had fallen heavily on the French trade to the
Levant, where the Russians had obtained a signal
naval victory, to the demolition of the Turkish fleet,
and where they paid little regard to the merchantmen
of France.</p>

<p>In this suspense, the courier not being returned
from Spain, the Parliament met; but first must be
mentioned two memorable events.</p>

<p>About four days before the opening of the Houses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
Lord Mansfield, Speaker of the Lords, acquainted
the King with his intention of quitting that post.
As there was so little time for supplying his place,
both the King and Lord North were grievously offended
with him;<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> but to the public it was matter
of triumph and ridicule, pusillanimity being the sole
reason of his abandoning so lucrative a post. Lord
Chatham had sent him word, that he would inquire
into and complain of the administration of justice
in this country, four of the judges being become
dependent on the Court—his Lordship as Speaker of
the House of Lords, and three of the others as Commissioners
of the Great Seal. The panic occasioned
by that threat operated so strongly, that the King
was obliged to determine on the Attorney-General
for Lord Keeper; but as his health would not allow
him to officiate immediately, Lord Mansfield, hoping
that he had deprecated the thunder by publishing
his intended resignation, consented to act for a few
days; and by degrees recovering his abject spirits,
was reconciled by the sweetness of the profit, and
remained Speaker.</p>

<p>The second event hinted at, was the death of Mr.
George Grenville. He had been dangerously ill in
the summer, had recovered in some degree, relapsed,
and had been brought to town in October for advice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
where he soon fell into a desperate state, followed
by a delirium that lasted to his death, which
happened the very morning the Parliament met.
His body being opened, his case appeared most singularly
uncommon: his ribs were carious or quite
worn away, and his skull as thin as paper. This extraordinary
malady was imputed to a disorder in his
blood, which had penetrated to the blood-vessels of
his bones, and had corroded them.</p>

<p>Mr. Grenville was, confessedly, the ablest man
of business in the House of Commons, and, though
not popular, of great authority there from his spirit,
knowledge, and gravity of character.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> His faults,
however, had been capital, and to himself most
afflicting. His injudicious Stamp Act had exposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
us to the risk of seeing all our Colonies revolt;
and his resentment of the repeal had prevented
him from ever forgiving Lord Chatham and Lord
Rockingham, a sincere junction with whom might
have driven the Court to restore him to power.
His rash and ungrateful provocation of the Favourite,
his indecently taking part with the Bedfords
in their violent insult to the Princess on
the Regency Bill, his forcing the King to break
his word and turn out Mr. Mackenzie, and his
silly parsimony in stinting the King’s expense in
trifles, were crimes that had never been forgiven—the
King, the Princess, and the Favourite being
as weak in not pardoning him, as he had been
in offending. No man would have seconded their
views with more resolution or a more vindictive
spirit. This was well-known to Lord Mansfield,
who had constantly aimed at the restitution of
Grenville, and whose recent panic had been increased
by the prospect of Grenville’s death, having
probably been privy to, if not the mediator of,
a secret treaty that came out after Grenville expired.
The latter, in short, had made his peace
with Lord North, and was ready to accept almost
any place. A new coldness that appeared between
Lord Chatham and Lord Temple was no doubt
owing to this transaction, Grenville depending too
much on his brother for the reversion of the family<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
estate to have dared to treat with the Court, unless
secure of Lord Temple’s sanction. That coldness,
however, was laid on the private affairs of the
family. A panegyric immediately pronounced by
Lord North on Grenville on the day of his death—a
promise made, and soon performed, of taking
care of Whateley, his secretary—the revolt of Lord
Suffolk and Lord Hyde (Grenville’s intimate friends)
to the Court—their ensuing preferments, and the
accession of almost all his faction to the majority,
to the absolute dereliction, not only of Lord Chatham,
but of Lord Temple, confirmed the negotiation—at
least, proved how secure Lord North
had been of Grenville’s concurrence. To Lord Temple’s
factious ambition his brother’s death was fatal.
He could not command a vote in either House,
nor could avoid the part he took of declaring
his intention of abandoning politics. Lord Chatham
was left almost as destitute of followers; and
Lord Rockingham, his competitor Grenville being
removed, now depended on being named to the
Treasury, should Lord Chatham ever recover power:
but Grenville’s death was no step to the success
of the Opposition.</p>

<p class="center b2">1770.</p>

<p>The King’s speech to both Houses affected firmness,
though it betrayed a want of it; for, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
it blustered, and called the Falkland Islands <em>the possession</em>
of his Crown, and promised not only to
support the just rights and interests of his people,
but went so far as to say he would not disarm
till convinced of the sincerity of other powers
(meaning France); yet, by imputing the seizure
of the Isle to the Governor of Buenos Ayres, as
if not authorized by the Crown of Spain, it openly
presented an excuse which the King of Spain
might make, if he would be so good as to condescend
so far. Nor could the suspicion dropped
against the sincerity of France avail much; they
knew our Court too well to misinterpret our real
disposition. As the Opposition was more in doubt
what part the Ministers did actually intend to take,
and as Mr. Grenville’s death prevented the appearance
of the Lords Temple, Chatham, and Lyttelton,
little was said in either House, except a few words
by Lord Rockingham and the Duke of Richmond,
the former of whom seemed rather to approve war,
as did the complexion of both Houses. Lord North
spoke prudently, but confessing he did not think
the Falkland Islands an adequate occasion of war.
Colonel Barré attacked the Ministers on their neglect
(and, indeed, the lapse of a year since the
first advice of Spain’s hostile intentions was the
great blemish of the business); they had, he said,
wasted three years in hunting down a wretched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
scribbler, (Wilkes,) while all the world knew that
Gibraltar and Ireland were defenceless (a most
indiscreet avowal at the eve of a war!) He did
not know who advised in military matters, yet he
knew who did <em>not</em>, though so very proper; but
that person, (Conway,) he heard, had retired from
the Cabinet Council. “Yes,” cried he, correcting
himself, and turning towards Lord Barrington, “I
know who has sometimes commanded” (alluding
to the slaughter in St. George’s Fields). The contemptible
description of Wilkes was in consequence
of Lord Shelburne’s plan of annihilating that demagogue,
against whom Parson Horne was now waging
open, though anonymous, war in the newspapers.
The Court had soon afterwards the satisfaction of
seeing them worry one another in print by name.</p>

<p>Barré’s attack called up Lord Barrington, who
uttered the most improper, the most impertinent,
and most offensive speech, <em>in every light</em>, that could
be conceived. He did not know, he declared, an
officer in England fit to be commander-in-chief.
Could any man name one to him? where was
any such man? if there was, if anybody would
point him out, he would recommend him to his
Majesty. “It was said,” continued he, “in Queen
Anne’s reign, that Dr. Ratcliffe and an old woman
could cure an ague; so, the Adjutant-General (General
Harvey) and he (Barrington) could make the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
best commander-in-chief.” Disgraceful as such a
declaration was, if true,—indiscreet to make to the
enemy, a war approaching,—indecent to the Duke
of Gloucester, who was sitting in the gallery,—to
General Conway, on whom all eyes turned, as on
one on whom the choice would of course fall,—and
insolent as it was to all our other Generals; yet
had not absurdity dictated this public affront to
the army—an affront offered by the Secretary
at War. Knowingly, nay artfully, had the dirty
little creature exposed himself to so much resentment.
He knew, in short, that the King was
jealous of the command of the army; that he trusted
to its attachment against any violence from his
subjects; that he would not confide even in his
devoted brother, nor in the integrity (because
founded on constitutional principles) of General
Conway. It was an officious declaration that commander-in-chief
there was to be none; it was an
indirect method of saving the King the pain, or
rather the blush, of refusing the command to his
brother; and the King’s ensuing silence, and his
continued favour to Barrington, left no doubt but
the zeal was kindly accepted.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> The offence grated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
the chief officers, men of renowned bravery and
service, such particularly as the Generals Amherst
and Monckton. Lord Waldegrave and General
Howard took up the affront warmly without doors,
and happy was the officious tool to escape without
a personal quarrel. It was not, perhaps, the least
part of his elaborate indecency, that, had a war
ensued, the soldiery might have been impressed
with contemptuous ideas of their leaders; but servility
cares not how much it sacrifices national
interest when pursuing its own. General Harvey,
the King’s real confidant in military business, pretended
to lament that Lord Barrington had pointed
him out as responsible for the army—a modesty
calculated to enforce the impression.</p>

<p>In consequence of Wilkes’s opposition to pressing,
Brass Crosby, the new Lord Mayor, one of his
most steady partisans,<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> consulted Lord Chatham on
the legality of that practice. That lord, not apt to
discountenance any measure that tended to carry on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
war against the House of Bourbon, recommended
to the magistrate to consult Dunning, Glynn, and
Wedderburne. To his queries, whether the Admiralty
were authorized to issue press warrants of
themselves, or under the direction of the Privy
Council; whether the warrant annexed was legal;
and whether the Lord Mayor was compellable to
back those warrants, and at what risk if he refused;
the three lawyers replied, that the practice was
warranted by length of time and national defence,
and even in some cases by the legislature; that it
had been noticed in courts of law, and without
reproof; and that they saw no objection to its being
executed by the Admiralty under the direction of
the Privy Council; that the form of the warrant
did indeed to them seem very objectionable, but
that for that very reason the sanction of the magistrate
was the more requisite to check and control
the abuse; and therefore, though they did not
deem the Lord Mayor compellable to sign the warrant,
nor liable to punishment for refusing, they
referred it to his Lordship’s prudence, whether for
the peace of the City and preservation of the subject,
he would not conform to the practice of most
of his predecessors on such occasions.</p>

<p>This decision not being satisfactory to the party,
the City chose to bestow premiums on voluntary
enlisters; in which they were followed by Bristol,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
Edinburgh, and a few other towns. At the same
time another remonstrance to the King was voted
by the Common Council, though not unanimously,
and was presented on the 21st by the Lord
Mayor, attended by Trecothick, Townshend, Oliver,
Stephenson, and a few more. His Majesty told
them, that having seen no cause to alter his
opinion expressed in his former answer, he could
not comply with their request to dissolve the
Parliament.</p>

<p>A strange incident, though of no consequence,
deserves to be mentioned, as it will show what deep
impression the temper of the times had made on an
honest mind, though the general corruption of the
age had regarded the constitutional considerations
lately agitated, as questions of interest rather than
of principle. Sir Walter Blacket, a rich independent
gentleman, had, though a Tory, voted the
last year that Wilkes was capable of sitting as
member for Middlesex,—a vote he had probably
given against his opinion to secure his popularity at
Newcastle, a town not less remarkable than London
or Lynn for its attachment to liberty and to
the cause of Wilkes. Sir Walter appeared suddenly
in the House of Commons, and rising, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à propos</i> to
nothing, with much perturbation, told the House
that he had laboured under extreme anxiety of
mind and repentance for the vote he had given in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
favour of Wilkes; that he had had no peace since—had
gone abroad for his health—was that moment
returned, and, getting out of his chaise, would not
wait an instant till he had satisfied his conscience;
that he hoped this declaration would be for ever
remembered, and that the resolution against Wilkes
would never be cancelled,<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a>—a delicacy of conscience
that did honour to the penitent; but, good God!
how weak are men, when priests and the partisans
of power can infuse such sentiments into their
devotees in favour of arbitrary government; and
when sense, self-preservation, and tenderness of
their posterity’s security, cannot instil equal compunction
into those who betray the common rights
of mankind! Sir Walter’s scruples were regarded
as the effects of a weak head and sick body: Lord
Mansfield, Wedderburne, Norton, and an hundred
more, were men of strong understandings, and never
repented. Even cowardice could not amend the
first. He went so far in the coldest fit of his panic
as to order a new trial of the printer of Junius,
because the jury had inserted the word <em>only</em> in their
sentence, pretending it implied a discordance in
their verdict.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of November, the Duke of Richmond
moved the Lords to address the King for copies
of all papers relating to the seizure of the Falkland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
Islands. Lord Weymouth objected, pleading
that the negotiation was actually pending; the demand
might, in a week, be proper. Lord Chatham,
who supported the motion, turned his fire chiefly
against the opposers of pressing, and declared that
if any lord would move it, he would second him
for bringing to the bar of the House the Alderman
who had obstructed the practice. Lord Hillsborough,
who was a pompous composition of ignorance
and want of judgment,<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> told the House most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
indiscreetly, that he had seen the Spanish papers,
and would venture to say that we should have full
satisfaction in three days. The Duke of Richmond
(so little connection was there in the Opposition)
declared against pressing. Provoked at this contradiction,
and glad of an opportunity of worrying
inferior capacity, Lord Chatham, at whose desire
the motion had been made, broke out against Lord
Hillsborough and against the Opposition too. To
revenge himself on the Duke, he spoke of the
Opposition with contempt, and told them, that
though the Ministers might do wrong, their opponents
were too weak to force them out of place;
that for himself he was connected with nobody (a
needless declaration, as all men saw); that he despised
popularity, and was not likely, from his age or
inclinations, ever to be Minister again (the latter,
a fruitless declaration, that all men disbelieved).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
Of Lord Hillsborough he said, that all our present
misfortunes were owing to his tyranny and ignorance;
and that, except Lord Rochford, not one of
the Ministers had seen six weeks of business before
they were raised to the first employments in the
State. Gibraltar, he declared, was so weak, that
the Spaniards might walk into it when they pleased,
and then into England; and that there were not
above eleven ships manned in our service. In the
City, he said, there was a malevolent party who did
nothing but mischief (meaning Wilkes and his
adherents—a tribute he paid to his friend, Lord
Shelburne); and he abused the rich men there and
the Asiatic opulence of Leadenhall Street,—men
who thought of nothing but obtaining commissaryships
and commissions of remittance; and with his
usual pretensions to intelligence, offered to bet a
thousand pounds that Spain had already struck
some important blow,—an insinuation (though unfounded)
that gave an alarm as if Gibraltar were
already taken. In answer to the charge on the
Ministers of inexperience, Lord Weymouth reminded
him that his Lordship himself, and his
friend, Lord Shelburne, and ally, Lord Rockingham,
had stood in the same predicament of ignorance
of business, when they appeared at the head
of affairs; and he told the Duke of Richmond,
who had threatened their heads, that if the Opposition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
had no mercy, he would at least confide in
their justice. Lord Lyttelton said he was so sensible
of our unprovided situation, that he was afraid
even to express his fears. Lord Shelburne was
severe on the Duke of Grafton. Lord Sandwich
boasted of enjoying and liking to enjoy the smiles
of the Court, which all Ministers, he said, had ever
sought to possess, except a late detestable and
insignificant set. Lord Rockingham, at whom the
arrow was levelled, asked, if Lord Sandwich and his
friends had possessed the smiles of the Court when
they were turned out for their insolence on the
Regency Bill? At eight at night the motion was
rejected by 61 to 25.</p>

<p>The same question moved by Dowdeswell the
same day in the other House met with the like
fate, being rejected by 225 against 201. But the
victim of the debate was Lord Barrington, who was
so roughly handled by Colonel Barré and General
Howard on his late declaration of the incapacity
of the general officers, that his confusion and absurdity
augmented each other,—he at once, and in
the same breath, adhering to his former opinion,
and yet maintaining that he had been misunderstood.
The persecution continuing, the Speaker
was forced to interpose and bring him off. General
Conway, speaking severely of those who endeavoured
to alienate the affections of the subjects from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
the King, was warmly attacked by Burke, who
represented the accusation as addressed to the Parliamentary
opponents, whom Conway denied he had
meant, saying, he had great esteem for some of
them, especially for one family (the Cavendishes),
and for whom he had great gratitude, too. This
was in contradistinction to Lord Rockingham and
Burke, one of whom had neglected, and the other
attacked him.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<p>The courier from Spain had arrived on the 19th,
and it was believed that the Prince of Masserano
had at the same time received powers to give us
satisfaction. This opinion, and Lord Hillsborough’s
declaration, had raised the stocks; which fell again
in a few days, when it was known that, though
Spain did not refuse to restore the island, yet she
insisted on our acknowledging her right to it,—a
concession rendered doubly difficult on our part by
the King’s speech, in which he had pronounced it the
right of his people, and promised as such to maintain
it. Whatever latitude was allowed to the
Spanish Ambassador, it was no wonder that he was
tenacious of his master’s pretensions, when Lord
North had acknowledged publicly that he did not
think the island worth going to war for, and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
Lord Chatham had no less publicly proclaimed our
weakness both to Spain and France. Mr. Grenville’s
singular declaration on Corsica had encouraged
the French to pursue their point against that
island; and though the opinion of each might well
be defended, neither Lord North nor Mr. Grenville
had been driven by a clamour for war to avow their
pacific sentiments. Lord Chatham excused his display
of our inability by pleading that France and
Spain must have known our situation without his
avowal of it; but it was an ill-timed modesty in
him, who was not ignorant how much haughtiness
and defiance from his mouth imposed on both those
Courts. There was, in truth, great want of men at
this time from many causes. The superior pay
given by the merchants, the loss of men in the late
war not yet repaired, the draughts for India, and
considerable migration from Scotland and Ireland
to the Colonies, had drained the country. The navy
was in a wretched condition; Lord Egmont, while
head of the Admiralty, had wasted between four
and five hundred thousand pounds on pompous
additions to the dockyards. His successor, Sir Edward
Hawke, though so brave and fortunate a commander,
had never been a man of abilities, and was
now worn out, grown indolent, and was almost
superannuated, paying so little attention to the
fleet, that the ships were rotted in harbour, and of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
five ordered to Gibraltar, four had returned as
being in too bad a condition to proceed, and the
fifth was found rotten before it went to sea. This
was as imprudently mentioned in debate by the
Duke of Richmond,—an inconvenience resulting
from the publicity of our counsels, and a weapon
not justifiably, though frequently used by Oppositions.
It was more inexcusable that even the
newspapers took the liberty of advertising our enemies
of our deficiencies, or of what they imagined our
intended measures, of which I will quote an instance.
The “Swallow” sloop was sheathed with copper.
Being the first attempt of the kind, the newspapers
concluded, and printed their idea, that she was
destined to the West Indies; thus pointing out to
the jealousy and enmity of Spain a proper object of
their attention.</p>

<p>The suspicions of the public that war must ensue
were increased on the 24th at night, all officers
being suddenly ordered to their posts, and Lord
Howe appointed Commander of the squadron in the
Mediterranean. Yet we had not above sixteen
ships manned, and the regiments were very incomplete.
Happily the navy of Spain was as ill provided
with men, and in no condition to profit by
our defenceless position. At the same time arrived
the new Ambassador from France, the Comte de
Guines,—a symptom, at least, that Choiseul, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
whom he was attached, was desirous we should
believe that France intended peace. The negotiation,
however, remained in the hands of Monsieur
Francés, as more conversant with the preceding
transaction. This was a very shrewd artful man,
who had privately, some time before his public appearance,
lived here unknown for three years, in
which time he made himself master of our language
and affairs. He was the confidential creature of
Choiseul.</p>

<p>Still was not Wilkes or the Middlesex election
forgotten. Mr. Phipps moved in the House of
Commons for leave to bring in a bill to correct
informations <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex officio</i>. Dunning and Wedderburne
supported the motion; but it was rejected by 150
to 70.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> It was not to the honour of the popular
hero (Wilkes) that he was at this time cast in a suit
brought against him by a French jeweller whom he
had defrauded of jewels at Paris. A season of such
warmth naturally produced many personalities in
Parliament. Charles Fox, the rising genius of the
time, had a gross altercation with Wedderburne on
an amendment proposed to Mr. Grenville’s bill for
regulating elections, in which the House was forced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
to interpose, and obliged both to ask pardon for their
intemperance. A parallel adventure happened
among the Lords in a debate for continuing the
prohibition of exporting corn, when the Duke of
Richmond saying that their chamber was reduced
to sit only for registering the dictates of the Crown,
or for concurring with the decrees of the Commons,
Lord Halifax rose with much heat, said it was
a false accusation, and he would never hear such
words. It was true that the Chancellor Hardwicke
had governed that assembly with solemn decency,
and, by his own authority, and that of the Pelhams,
had restrained much of the liberty of debate; yet
not long before, John Duke of Argyle, and others at
other periods, had not suffered themselves to be
manacled by such formality. It is as true, on the
other hand, that the House of Lords being an
assembly far less numerous than the Commons, is
less turbulent and more observant of decorum. The
nobility, too, are by principle more devoted to the
Crown, and having less occasion to make their fortunes
by eloquence and the cultivation of talents
(though not less corrupt) than the Commons, acquiesce
from inability to the dictates of two or three
eminent lawyers, whom the Crown occasionally
raises to the peerage, after preferring them to the
Great Seal or to the posts of Chief Justices.</p>

<p>Lord Chatham, the same day, not intimidated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
by Lord Halifax’s passion, who was a proud empty
man, and mistook anger for argument, moved to
call for Captain Hunt of the “Tamer” sloop, who
had been driven off the Falkland Islands by the
Spaniards. Lord Chatham made a fine oration, and,
though often vexed by the Lords Sandwich and
Denbigh, was, when Lord Mansfield was silent,
as his fears now made him, far superior to all
his other adversaries; they were babies to him.
He said the Ministers had bungled themselves into
such a situation that they could neither make
war nor peace; that he should have arguments
against them, of whichever they should make option;
that he would insist on restitution and reparation,
though he supposed they were then actually
begging peace at Versailles. He had been
blamed, he said, for indiscretion in divulging the
nakedness of his country; but it had been parental
kindness to give warning to the Ministers: and
what had he divulged that was not known to
every coffee-house boy in Portsmouth? He endeavoured
to soften his late attack on the City,
avowing, at the same time, that he had not, nor
ever had had, any connection with Wilkes. But
highly he commended the integrity of Sawbridge,
whom he was sorry he had not talked with before
that Alderman had opposed pressing. It was more
remarkable that he paid many compliments to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
candour of Lord Weymouth; the other Ministers,
in general, he said, were ignorant, futile, and incapable.
Lord Weymouth, as if in concert, professed
himself ready to resign his post, but declared
against Opposition. Neither Lord Temple
nor Lord Camden were present at the debate, nor
the Lords attached to the late Mr. Grenville. The
motion was rejected by 55 to 21, as was, by one
less on each side, another motion, likewise made
by Lord Chatham, for inquiring at what time the
Ministers had received intelligence that the Spaniards
intended to seize the Falkland Islands;—they
had known it in the preceding December—eleven
months! The French had previously settled on
a neighbouring little island, but had quitted it
to countenance the violence of Spain,—proof sufficient
of their co-operation in that hostility; not
that Choiseul was circumstanced in a manner that
would authorize him to assist them openly in hostilities,
but the treaty of Paris had convinced him
of the aversion to war in our Cabinet,—a conclusion
that now deceived him, and drew him into
inextricable perplexity, as I shall show presently.
Indeed, considering that, victorious or vanquished,
we always make disgraceful treaties, the nation
had little cause to prefer war. Forty thousand
seamen were now voted.</p>

<p>At this period, died the parent of the approaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
war, the Earl of Egmont, a man always ambitious,
almost always attached to a Court, yet, from
a singularity in his fortune, scarce ever in place.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></p>

<p>On the 5th of December, Lord Chatham moved
a resolution, (which was rejected by 52 to 20,)
the purport of which was, that the capacity of
being chosen a member of Parliament was ascertained
by law, and could not be set aside by any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
separate branch of the legislature. Lord Camden
supported the motion, but declaring he stood unconnected
with, and unattached to, any man.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> Lord
Mansfield, to soften his dreaded adversary, Lord
Chatham, paid many compliments to him on his
support of pressing; but, on his having urged the
necessity of dissolving the Parliament, represented
to him the impropriety of such a tempestuous measure
at the beginning of a war; yet no war was
begun, and, from the long suspense, men began
to conclude that no war would be declared. The
Spanish Ambassador was assiduous at Court, was
affectedly caressed there, and made no preparations
for departing.</p>

<p>But, though Lord Mansfield thus deprecated the
wrath of Lord Chatham, the indignation of the
friends of freedom was not so appeased. Serjeant
Glynn moved for an examination into the conduct
of the King’s Bench, and Alderman Oliver
named Lord Mansfield as the author of the grievances
from that Court. The House sat till near
one in the morning, but the question was lost
by 75 against 180.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
The next day, Colonel Onslow complained to
the House, and read, from a magazine called the
London Museum, a copy of a letter sent by the
Society of the Bill of Rights to the Colonies,
(signed by Serjeant Glynn amongst others,) which
almost invited them to rebel, and was a strong
libel on the Parliament.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> The King, in his speech,
had specified parts of the colony of Massachusett’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
Bay as guilty of very illegal practices and violences,
<em>though he had confessed<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> that, in most of the other
Colonies, the people had begun to depart from their
combinations against the mother country. New York,
in particular, had refused to concur in them.</em></p>

<p>The next day, an augmentation of twelve thousand
men to the army was voted, a wise measure,
as preparation for war is the best preventive.
Yet had we reason to depend on the pacific disposition
of the French Prime Minister. In a great
council held at Versailles, the Abbé du Terray,
Comptroller-General, a personal enemy of Choiseul,
proposed to join with Spain in the war, (either
to sound Choiseul’s intentions, or thinking him
not inclined to war,) and engaged to find the
necessary funds. He was supported by his instigator,
the Chancellor Maupeou; but the Duc de
Choiseul, (either suspecting a trap, or to pay court
to his master, who was most averse to the war,)
with great ability, knowledge, and eloquence, proved
so irrefragably the impossibility of finding money<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
sufficient, that the Comptroller-General confessed
himself convinced by the Duke’s arguments.</p>

<p>When the army was voted, General Conway took
notice that though the House was voting so large
an addition, yet no method was taken for raising
men. He hinted at several plans, particularly for
levying German Protestants; and he observed how
much the militia, become the favourite of several
Lords, engrossed the best recruits; his own nephew,
Lord Beauchamp, often gave thirty or forty pounds
for a sergeant from the Guards for his own regiment.
Sir Gilbert Elliot, after the debate, remarked
that Conway had <em>only</em> clashed with his nephew, his
friends, and the Minister. Grenville often said, that
he had rather have Conway against him than for
him, as then he knew all the hurt Conway could do
to him. He was, it is true, too great a refiner; but
what he thought right was always his guide, unless
when his judgment was warped by paying too much
regard to the good opinion of men—blemishes that,
like the small spots of ermine, were only striking
from the purity of the ground, and from the extreme
rarity of ground so pure. The hues of Elliot
and Grenville were not of such unsullied white.
Conway had now been trying to drive Lord Barrington
to embrace some plan, and had hinted many to
the King, who never took any further notice of
them, it being his Majesty’s rule, as Lord Holland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
had formerly told me, never to talk to any man but
on the business of his department; and Conway,
though the deepest master of his profession in the
island, happened not to be secretary! That silly
caution had been infused into the King by the
Princess and Lord Bute, lest it should give the person
consulted an opportunity of gaining his confidence,
by launching out beyond their province: every
audience terminated when each minister had received
his orders. To decline receiving information
from so able an officer as Conway, and one whom
he knew and had declared so disinterested and unambitious,
was not the method of rendering himself
proper to conduct the army; and Lord Barrington
was too ignorant beyond the routine of office to instruct,
and too servile to contradict him. General
Edward Harvey, the other royal confidant in military
matters, was a mere disciplinarian, and not
feared by the junto, being of no abilities or importance.</p>

<p>On the 10th of December was great expectation
of some solemn scene, Lord Mansfield having given
notice to the Lords on the 7th, that he had matter
of importance to lay before them. It was supposed
that he intended to make his defence against all the
late accusations. Though that did not prove entirely
the case, the day turned out very remarkable.
The House was crowded with members of the Commons,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
with strangers, and even foreigners. Lord
Mansfield produced and delivered to the clerk a
paper, containing the determination made by himself
and the four other judges of the King’s Bench,
on Woodfall’s demand of a new trial, which they
had refused to grant, and the reasons for which refusal
they had read, as their decree, in court. This
decree, he said, having been mentioned in that
House with indirect blame, and much misrepresented
to the public, he had brought that account
to be perused by their Lordships, who, if they
pleased, might take copies of it. He made no motion,
nor desired any notice to be taken of his paper,
which he delivered to the clerk. Lord Chatham,
in commending his candour in submitting his conduct
to examination, excepted against the mode,
and threw out many oblique censures. Lord Camden
also, not approving the manner, said, he supposed
Lord Mansfield did not mean to have the
paper entered in the journals; to which Lord Mansfield
answering he did not, the affair broke off, and
Lord Camden went away.</p>

<p>The Duke of Manchester then rose to make a
motion, and opening on the defenceless state of the
nation, mentioned the four ships sent to Gibraltar,
and obliged to return from being in too bad condition
to proceed. He was going on, but was called
to order by Lord Gower, who said those points were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
not fit to be divulged to the public and to foreign
ministers; and insisted on the House being cleared
of strangers, which, by the standing orders of both
Houses, any member may do in the House to which
he belongs, and which cannot be refused; but Lord
Gower, entering into debate, which no man may do
when he calls another to order, he was called to
order himself; the Duke of Richmond adding, that
the Ministry did not dare to hear their faults
laid open. Prodigious confusion ensued; and Lord
Chatham, in a violent emotion of rage, insisted on
being heard, which was impossible from the tumult;
and he would have distinguished between the occasion
and the general standing order, which, he maintained
Lord Gower had had no right to call for, as
the subject had not been the order of the day; but
he was wrong—and the majority called out violently
to have the order put in execution: but the
members of the other House refused to retire,
Dowdeswell declaring he would be the last man
that should go out. This resistance was unjustifiable,
and without example. Four other commoners,
who had brought up a bill from the other House,
said they were come with a message, and had a
right to be there; but they too were in the wrong,
for the rule is, that they should give notice to the
Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, and he, acquainting
the Lords, is sent to call the messengers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
to the bar, which had not been done. However,
the servants of the House of Lords were forced to
thrust out the Commons by violence, while Lord
Chatham, roaring in vain and unregarded, walked
out of the House in a rage, and the Court Lords continuing
to call out “Clear the House! clear the
House!” the Duke of Richmond cried out aloud,
“So you will of every honest man!” and followed
Lord Chatham, as did the Dukes of Bolton, Manchester,
Portland, Devonshire, Northumberland, the
Marquis of Rockingham, the Earls of Huntingdon,
Abingdon, Fitzwilliam, Viscount Torrington, and
the Lords Abergavenny, Archer, Besborough, Shelburne,
and Milton. Lord Lyttelton was not present:
Lord Hardwicke remained with the courtiers.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></p>

<p>The members of the Commons went down in a
fury to their own House; Burke and the opponents
rejoicing in an opportunity of endeavouring to make
a breach between the two Houses. George Onslow
of the Treasury, a noisy, indiscreet man, who sometimes
did well recollect his father’s inflexible maintenance
of the dignity of the Commons, but whose
connections should not have led him to encourage
the opponents in setting the two Houses at variance,
made complaint of the injurious manner in which
they had been thrust out by force, and moved for
a Committee to inspect the journals of the Lords<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
on that occasion, the only regular manner of coming
at the proceedings, for the House of Lords being
a court of record, their journals are open to the
public, which is not the case with the other House.
Lord North, to humour the Commons, joined in
the blame, but dissuaded the motion. It was battled,
however, for two hours; and some Lords
who had come thither, were turned out: but the
motion was rejected by the influence of the courtiers.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></p>

<p>The same day General Conway laid before the
House a plan for adding a thousand men to the
regiment of artillery on a cheap scheme of 17,000<i>l.</i>,
which, if executed in the ordinary method, would
have cost 24,000<i>l.</i> Hearing that they would oppose
it, he had sent his plan to Lord George (Sackville)
Germaine and Colonel Barré, but both returned it
with compliments, the first saying he should only
make some objections to the mode; the other that
he should not oppose it. They both now did make
some objections; and others of the Opposition
blamed Conway for not having digested more plans
for the army. Conway answered that he had done
his duty in his office, but was not consulted beyond
it, nor in any confidence. This was a declaration
they wished. T. Townshend the younger and others
exclaimed on <em>his</em> not being trusted! What could the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
country expect, they said, if such a man, and at the
head of his profession, was in no confidence with the
Ministers? Conway replied, he had not complained,
nor did he complain; he had stated the fact, and
was content with the confidence placed in him by
his master. His plan was adopted.</p>

<p>On the 11th, the seceding Lords returned to
their House, and fourteen entered a protest against
their being impeded from proceeding the day before.</p>

<p>Lord Camden then severely resumed Lord Mansfield’s
conduct in delivering the paper, which, in fact,
was universally condemned as timid, wanting dignity,
and narrowed to a single case, when many more accusations
were stirring against him. The proceeding
itself, Lord Camden said, was most irregular,
and the substance of the paper deserving particular
reprehension. He had considered the paper with
the utmost care, but had found it unintelligible.
That if taken in one sense of the words, he understood,
and should agree to it: but there was another
obvious to which the words were liable; and if
taken in that sense, he would pledge himself to the
House to prove them illegal and unconstitutional;
and therefore he must desire to put to his Lordship
some interrogatories.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></p>

<p>Lord Mansfield, with most abject soothings, paid
the highest compliments to Lord Camden, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
declared how much he had always courted his
esteem; and therefore from his candour had not
expected that treatment. He professed he had
studied the point more than any other in his life, and
had consulted all the judges on it, except indeed
his Lordship: but that he must object to being
taken by surprise, nor could he submit to answer
interrogatories. “Interrogatories!” cried Lord
Chatham, starting up, “was ever anything heard
so extraordinary? is it taking that noble lord by
surprise who has just declared that he has studied
the point all his life, and has taken the opinions of
all the judges on it? And of all mankind does it
become that Lord to refuse interrogatories, who
has so recently imprisoned a man [Brindley] for a
year or two, for refusing to submit to them?” But
the point, he gave the noble Lord notice should be
fathomed, and he would bring it to issue. However,
he would give his Lordship time, and would
let the matter sleep till after the holidays: but he
insisted that Lord Camden’s paper of interrogatories
should be left with the clerk, as Lord
Mansfield’s had been; which the House could not
refuse.</p>

<p>The dismay and confusion of Lord Mansfield was
obvious to the whole audience; nor did one peer
interpose a syllable in his behalf; even the Court
(whom he had been serving by wresting the law,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
and perverting it to the destruction of liberty, and
his guilt in which practices was proclaimed by
his dastard conscience) despised his pusillanimity
and meanness; for to avert the indignation of the
other side, he had declared in his speech that
he was not attached to the Ministry, nor had any
obligations to the King. Lord Frederic Campbell,
his friend, but hurt at his wretched shuffling, told
me, the persecution had been stirred up by Mansfield’s
own tool and associate Sir Fletcher Norton,
who hoped it would drive him to give up the vast
post of Chief Justice, to which Norton, despairing
of the great Seal, flattered himself he should succeed.</p>

<p>So much consciousness of guilt on Lord Mansfield’s
part, with so much inveteracy on Lord Chatham’s,
promised a scene worthy of the public
attention. Will it be believed that not a word
more was said on the subject, either when the
Parliament reassembled after the holidays, or during
the whole remainder of the session? At the
end of April, I asked the Duke of Richmond the
meaning of that silence; he gave me this solution:—“Early
in the session Constantine Phipps told
Mr. Dowdeswell that he intended to move for an
inquiry into the conduct of the judges relative to
juries. Dowdeswell said it would be best to have a
meeting upon it. ‘No,’ said Phipps, ‘I do not like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
meetings: men are often borne down at them
against their opinions. I will give notice of my
intention without further concert.’ Serjeant Glynn
said he would do the same the next day. Dowdeswell
told him there was not time for concert: it
would be like the Minister reading the King’s
speech at the cockpit, after it has been settled.
Glynn, however, gave his notice. On that the
Rockingham party determined to act for themselves,
and drew up a bill to ascertain what directions
judges should give to juries. They showed it
to Lord Chatham after he had attacked Lord Mansfield.
He disapproved it much, but offered to support
it if they would make it more personal to Lord
Mansfield. They refused.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> All they meant, they
said, was prospect, not retrospect: as if branding a
crime committed, were not a better guard than a
provision against committing it. Then he must be
against them, said Lord Chatham. They consulted
Lord Camden. He told them Lord Chatham had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
driven him into the attack on Lord Mansfield,
which he did not like, and in which at last he
declared he would meddle no farther:<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> he did not
care to have all the twelve judges against him.
When the Rockinghams moved their bill, Dunning,
Lord Shelburne, and the rest of Lord Chatham’s
connection were strongly against them.”</p>

<p>Some few days after the Duke had given me this
account, Lord Chatham’s cause against Sir William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
Pynsent’s relation, which the Earl had brought by
appeal before the House of Lords, and had by them
been referred to the judges, came on before their
Lordships for the judges to make their report.
They were preparing to give their opinions, five on
one side, and three on the other, when Lord Mansfield
arriving, said a new idea had struck him, and
he was sure he could reconcile the sentiments of all
the judges. He stated his position (which is not to
my purpose to detail), they pocketed their briefs
and notes, said they were persuaded they should all
return of one opinion the next day, and retired.
They did return, and gave the cause for Lord Chatham,
not without censure from the public on the
two Lords; the one, as men thought, buying his
indemnity by the sacrifice of another man’s property;
the other waiving justice due to the public to purchase
the decision of a suit in his own favour: yet,
as the fact happened so late as the 6th of May,
<em>after</em> the Duke of Richmond had allowed to me
that the pursuit against Lord Mansfield was
dropped, servility, to which, as has been seen, he
was enough prone, might have no share in this
instance. I have anticipated an event of the next
year, that I might present the reader with the
whole transaction together.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> I return to the end of
the year 1770.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
The Duke of Manchester, on the 11th, renewed
the interrupted motion of an address to the Crown
to station a strong and sufficient naval force to
guard Gibraltar, Minorca, and Jamaica. Lord
Chatham supported the motion, and said, he knew
there was not a Spaniard but would pawn his shirt
to recover Gibraltar; and, therefore, he must yet
suspect Spain; though he did confess he believed
France was in earnest desirous of preserving peace:
that though he knew the dismal condition of our
navy, half of which was rotten, yet he trusted we
had still a force that was a match for all the world;
that force lay in the bravery of our land and sea
officers. But if there is a war, men, said he, of all
parties must be preferred. Lord Gower took this
up very injudiciously, asking if Sir Jeffery Amherst
had not lately been appointed a Governor, though
not attached to the Court? Lord Shelburne replied,
Sir Jeffery had lost 4000<i>l.</i> a year, and after
repeated neglects, had only obtained a government:
and the Duke of Richmond more shrewdly observed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
that Lord Gower’s own brother-in-law, Lord
Dunmore, had just had <em>two</em> governments given to
him, New York, and then Virginia. The Duke of
Grafton attacked Lord Chatham roughly, who generally
bore his severity, perhaps from contempt, as
tamely as Lord Mansfield Lord Chatham’s. Lord
Sandwich said, all the motion could do, would be to
take merit or demerit from the Administration. It
was rejected by above 40 to 12. As the Ministers
affected to make military preparations, a resolution
passed to supply the voted augmentation of the
army with Irish or Germans.</p>

<p>It was with more alacrity that the Treasury carried
a vote of a fourth shilling in the pound on
land, by a majority of 299 to 121. The Bedford
squadron, discontented with Lord North, who placed
no confidence in them, and leaning with Lord Weymouth
and Wood to Lord Chatham, who they
feared would be Minister, had whispered objections
to the increase of the tax. The Duke of Bedford
himself declared openly against it, and Rigby, as if
by his order, had some time before in the House of
Commons owned he should disapprove it, unless
there actually should be a war. He now treacherously
advised Lord North to postpone the demand
till after Christmas; but the Minister doubting with
reason the sincerity of the faction, would not be
turned aside from his purpose, but carried it with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
spirit, Rigby absenting himself for a real or pretended
fit of the gout.</p>

<p>On the 13th Lord George Germaine moved for
a conference with the Lords on their late expulsion
of the Commons. His motive, he said, was to
recommend unanimity between the two Houses;
insinuating, in order to create variance between
them, that they had quarrelled. But the motion
was rejected by a large majority; but not till
Colonel Barré had drawn a severe picture of the
Court-Lords, particularly of the Earls of Marchmont
and Denbigh, who had distinguished themselves
with most bitterness against the Commons.
All had been going on quietly, said Barré, when on
a sudden a set of raggamuffins had interrupted the
debate, and first turned out the Lords, and then the
Commons. They were the most ill-favoured rogues
he had ever seen; one with a long meagre face and
long nose, whom by his brogue he presently knew for
a Scotchman. Another, still worse, with such a villanous
aspect, squinting eyes, and features so compressed
that his hooked nose could scarce squeeze
itself into its place, was so hideous, that he had
been persuaded it was not a human face, but a
mask. The likenesses were too strong to be misapplied—yet
the two Lords took care not to acknowledge
their portraits.</p>

<p>The next day Lord George Sackville Germaine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
and Lord George Cavendish, moved that no messages
should be sent to the other House but by the
eldest sons of peers, who alone would not be in
danger of being insulted there; and that such
eldest sons should be restrained from going thither
on any other occasion. Colonel Onslow, alluding
to the two Lords, said, the motion ought to have
been that no message should be sent but by the
younger sons of peers; and alluding to Lord George
Sackville, that the motion seemed to imply timidity.
Governor Johnstone went much further, and said,
he did not conceive <em>that any man was proper to take
care of the honour of that House, who had forfeited his
own honour</em>. The motion was rejected by about
130 to 40.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></p>

<p>So gross an insult as Johnstone’s called for chastisement,
and did prove how much the world and
he had mistaken Lord George Sackville. The latter
with temper that became the courage he showed,
took four days to settle his affairs and to make
provision for an infant of which his wife was just
delivered; behaving at the same time with a cheerful
indifference that deceived her and his whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
family. He then, taking T. Townshend for his
second, challenged Johnstone, and met him in Hyde
Park. The latter was accompanied by Sir James
Lowther. Each fired two pistols; Johnstone’s first
struck off the butt-end of Lord George’s. They
fired again; both missed, and the affair ended, exceedingly
to the honour of Lord George’s coolness
and intrepidity. The brutality of Johnstone shocked
everybody, especially as his character had as much of
the bully as the bravo in it; and as it was presumed
he had depended on Lord George’s supposed
want of spirit, or trusted to the publicity of the
affront for any consequences being prevented, which
is always dishonourable in the aggressor. His boisterous
reputation, and a vague anonymous challenge
given out in the newspapers to the author of a
<i>North Briton</i> on the Scotch, had recommended him
for this service to his patron, Sir James Lowther,
who, in resentment for Lord George’s deserting
him on the Cumberland election, had brooded over
it till now that he excited that ruffian’s assault.
But so odious was Sir James from the whole tenor
of his life, that Johnstone seemed the less hateful of
the two, especially as Sir James appeared to glut his
eyes with revenge.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> Such unaffected valour in Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
George revived suspicions in some that it was not
courage he had wanted at Minden; but so much
zeal for his country as should have balanced his
hatred of Prince Ferdinand.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
At this time, one Robert Morris, Secretary to the
Bill of Rights, published an outrageous letter to Sir
Richard Aston, a judge of the King’s Bench, who
had cast reflections on him in a trial—I think for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
stealing an heiress.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> The man was a pretended enthusiast,
and offered himself to the Court for a
martyr, and to the people for one of their representatives.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
The Ministers refused him the first honour,
and the people the second.</p>

<p>Nor was opposition confined solely to England.
The supple, but national Scots, who complained so
bitterly of English inveteracy, took a step at this
time which proved their rancour greater than that
of the southern Britons. It is not uncommon
for Scots to be chosen for English boroughs; yet
Lord Weymouth having recommended his cousin,
the Earl of Dysart, a Scottish peer, for one of the sixteen,
on the death of the Duke of Argyle, the Scotch
nobility, instigated by the Earl of Haddington,
mutinied against the King’s nomination of Lord
Dysart, because he had no estate in Scotland, and
because Lord Irwin, in the same predicament, was
already one of the sixteen. The Duke of Buccleugh,
the new Duke of Argyle, and the Earl of
March, all zealous courtiers, joined in the revolt;
for the Scotch were too quick-sighted not to perceive
that opposition was at least as good a path to
preferment as servility. They set up the Earl of
Breadalbane, and engaged never to vote for any
peer who should not support him. To stifle that
spirit, Lord Weymouth gave up his cousin Dysart,
and the King recommended the Earl of Stair; yet
the Opposition persisted, and Lord Stair was chosen
but by 28 votes against 19. The young Earl of
Buchan a few years before had attempted to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
a similar stand, but it being against a landed Scot,
was not supported. To soften the sacrifice to Lord
Dysart, the King offered him a green riband; but
he, who was one of the proudest, and not one of the
brightest of men, did not distinguish between the
King’s civility and the proscription of himself by his
Scottish brethren, and wrote to the Secretary of
State that he not only would not accept the riband,
but would never serve this King or any other.
Next year he asked a military preferment for his
brother, and was refused.</p>

<p>The negotiation about the Falkland Islands still
continued in suspense. The King of Spain adhered
to his declaration of reserving his claim entire, though
willing to relinquish the possession; and the public
were persuaded that there were different opinions
in the Ministry from threats thrown out by the
Duke of Bedford that he would go to the House of
Lords, and proclaim the necessity of declaring war.
Still was the surprise of mankind extreme, when,
on the 16th, it was known that Lord Weymouth had
resigned the Seals—a mysterious conduct, increased
by his own obstinate silence, and by the professions
of the Bedfords, that they had not been acquainted
with his intention, nor should resign with him. The
King, afraid of a breach between the Ministers and
him, offered to make any arrangement that might
accommodate him with any other place; but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
would take none. However,—to show that he did
not mean opposition, but would continue to support
the Administration, like the Duke of Grafton; and,
not ashamed of being obliged to those whom he
disserved,—he asked for the lucrative place of postmaster
for his brother, which was instantly granted;
the weak measures of the Court having reduced
them to be afraid of a man who had quitted them
only from fear. Such was the complexion of the
King’s whole conduct. By aiming at power which
he did not dare to exert, he was forced to court the
most servile, and buy dear the most worthless, never
conceiving that the firmest authority is that founded
on character, and on the respect paid to virtue. He
bought temporary slaves, who had the power of
manumitting themselves the moment they wished
to be bought over again. He lost his dominions in
America, his authority over Ireland, and all influence
in Europe, by aiming at despotism in England;
and exposed himself to more mortifications and humiliations
than can happen to a quiet doge of
Venice. Another feature in his character was, that
he could seem to forgive any injury or insult when
the offender could be of use to him; he never
remembered any service when the performer could
be of none.</p>

<p>The secret motives of Lord Weymouth’s resignation
were these:—at the beginning of Spain’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
hostilities, the King, who began to affect a military
turn, had been eager for war, and Lord Weymouth,
whose ambition aspired to the lead in the Administration,
had gone eagerly into the royal views. On
that plan, and encouraged by Wood’s awe of Lord
Chatham, they had thrown every damp on the negotiation,
and involved themselves in repeated
declarations of the war being unavoidable. Lord
North, of pacific mould, and the Scottish junto as
apprehensive as Wood that a war would bring back
Lord Chatham, had taken a contrary course, and
had brought back the King from his martial system.
Lord Weymouth, who would not have hesitated to
change his language had he thought peace could be
effected, chose rather to waive his ambition than his
security, and adhered to war. Nor was this all.
His extreme indolence and drunkenness made it
impossible that he should execute the duties of his
office in time of war. He seldom went to bed till
five or six in the morning, nor rose next day till
twelve or one. His parts must have been great,
for in that besotted state he was still able to express
himself in the House of Lords with elegance,
quickness, and some knowledge, in a few short sentences;
not indeed deserving all the applause bestowed
on them by his faction. A few reflections
on his character and on the time may be useful; as
it will seem extraordinary hereafter that a man so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
improperly compounded for a minister, should in a
government, partly popular, have been the hinge on
which so important a crisis turned.</p>

<p>Whether it is owing to the variations of our
climate, or to the uncertainty and fluctuations of
our Government; whether to the independence
that our freedom suggests; or whatever else be the
cause, it is certain that no other country produces
so many singular and discriminate characters as
England. And as the nature of our Government
excludes no man from attaining a share in it; and
as the licence of opposition and of the press suffers
the most severe scrutiny even into the private life
of all men in power, it is not surprising that there
should be a greater variety in the actors, and a
larger harvest of anecdotes relating to them than to
the Ministers of other nations. Here, too, the character
of the man influences his conduct. In monarchies,
the temper and disposition of the prince
gives the tone to his subjects and servants. When
ministers and factions awe the sovereign, <em>their</em>
passions, not <em>his</em>, prescribe their conduct. Never
was this truth so elucidated as in the first years of
George the Third. Having no predominant passion
of his own, but hypocrisy enough to seem to approve
whatever his Ministers for the time being
willed, almost every year of his reign wore a different
stamp. It began with popularity under Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
Bute, but veered as suddenly to Majesty at home.
Lord Chatham, had he had time, would have dictated
to Europe. Fox and Lord Holland established
universal corruption and revenge. Grenville exercised
rigour and economy. With Lord Rockingham
entered redress and relaxation. Lord Chatham’s
second Administration was an interregnum of inexplicable
confusion. The Duke of Grafton did as
little, without being out of his senses. The people
almost seized the reins next, and the Ministers, to
save themselves, were content to secure the doors
of the Cabinet and of the House of Commons from
being stormed, while both the King and the Parliament
were vilified and insulted. His Majesty
seemed almost as contented to let the populace
brave him, as he had been to let Lord Bute, Lord
Holland, and Grenville trample on them.</p>

<p>Among men of such various complexion, Lord
Weymouth was not the least singular. He was
tall, handsome, and, from a German education,
solemn and formal in his outward deportment. His
look spoke absence, and nothing in his ostensible
appearance discovered a symptom of the quickness,
cunning, and dissoluteness within. A perfect insensibility
produced constant and facile good humour;
yet his bent brow and constitutional pride
indicated no pleasantry or social mirth. His parts
were strong, his conception ready, his reasoning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
acute, his delivery short and perspicuous. His parts
must have been very strong to be capable of
emerging from his constant drunkenness and dissipation;
for though he had been well instructed,
had a retentive memory, and a head admirably
turned to astronomy and mechanics, he abandoned
all improvement so entirely, that it was wonderful
how he had gleaned so much common knowledge of
politics as embellished his short speeches, and for a
quarter of an hour in every debate infused into him
aptness and propriety. The becoming decency and
dignity of his appearance was all the homage he
paid to public opinion. He neither had nor affected
any solid virtue. He was too proud to court the
people, and too mean not to choose to owe his
preferments to the favour of the Court or the cabals
of faction. He wasted the whole night in drinking,
and the morning in sleep, even when Secretary of
State. No kind of principle entered into his plan
or practice; nor shame for want of it. He ruined
his tradesmen without remorse, and, if that was an
excuse, without thought; and with equal indifference
frequently saw bailiffs in his house: for pride is a
constitutional stoicism, independent of circumstances.
With as little sense of fashionable as of
real honour, he had often received letters with
demands of gaming debts, written in a style that
even such gentlemen seldom endure without resentment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
Taciturnity, except with his bacchanalian
companions, was his favourite habit, because it
harmonized with his prodigious indolence; and ambition,
though his only passion, could not surmount
his laziness,—though his vanity made him trust that
his abilities, by making him necessary, could reconcile
intrigue and inactivity. His timidity was womanish,
and the only thing he did not fear was the
ill opinion of mankind.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></p>

<p>The impropriety of such a character probably
convinced Wood that a temporary retreat was necessary;
and the confidence of the Bedford squadron
in their own strength disposed them to acquiesce
in it; for I cannot believe that, while their
conduct harmonized with Weymouth’s, they were
ignorant of his intentions. Lord Weymouth, Lord
Gower, the Duke of Grafton, and Lord Sandwich,
were more considerable in the House of Lords than
any Speakers that would remain in the Ministry;
so that if Lord North could carry through the
peace, they might still command terms; or if Lord
Chatham was forced upon the King, he must have
been glad of their support. But Lord North had
the sagacity to secure Lord Sandwich (between
whom and Weymouth was much jealousy), by
making him Secretary of State. The others escaped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
by having been less precipitate; and Lord Weymouth
and Wood remained the sole victims of their
own insidious artifices.</p>

<p>No man was more troubled at this sudden resignation
than Monsieur Francés, the French Resident.
As I was very intimate with him, he vented his
lamentations to me in several visits. He said the
Bedfords were <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">des scélérats</i>; that they might have
made peace three months before; and that that
very morning he himself had offered to Lord North
to set out directly for Paris, and would pawn his
head if he did not return with peace; that Lord
North wanted courage, and was too jealous of
Spain—that the King of Spain would easily have
made peace at first if we would not have armed.
I was far from agreeing that Lord North had been
to blame in being prepared. Wood, said Francés,
had nearly blown up a war with France the last
year on the affair of the flag, having insisted on
giving an answer to their memorial, though Francés,
who had been forced to demand an answer in form,
had begged Wood not to give one.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> He imputed
much of the delays in the negotiation to Wood’s
stock-jobbing (in which, no doubt, no man was
more capable of detecting another than Francés,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
who was deep in that mystery himself), and said he
had sent to Lord Weymouth on the 14th to ask
that he might make new propositions; but the
other had refused to see him.</p>

<p>Though I knew how ill-disposed Francés was to
this country, and that Monsieur du Châtelet was suspected
of having incited the King to the seizure of
the Falkland Islands, and that the Duc de Choiseul
but waited for the means, and would then have found
an opportunity of attacking us; yet I was and am
persuaded, that Francés at that moment acted with
sincerity. Nothing could be more opposite to Choiseul’s
interest than a war between France and England
at that juncture, in which he was vehemently
pressed by the King of Spain to take a part. He
had proved in council, to the confusion and confession
of his enemies, that the finances of France
could not possibly support a war; and his own
master’s aversion to war would expose him to still
greater dangers, as the mistress and her Cabal could
not fail to avail themselves of the Monarch’s disgust
to a Minister already tottering, should the least disadvantage
attend their arms. The crisis, however,
of Choiseul’s fate advanced so rapidly, that I am
persuaded, however strong Choiseul’s instructions
to Francés had been, he himself by this time had
taken another resolution. He had found that his
disgrace was determined; he had no support but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
the King of Spain, who pushed him to declare, and
with whose Prime Minister, Grimaldi,<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> he was intimately
leagued. Despair decided. Could he obtain
his master’s consent to declare war, he himself
might be necessary; and he secured the protection
of Spain. He marched forty thousand men to the
coast opposite to England, under the command of
his brother Stainville; and by that rash step brought
on his own fall. His enemies, gained by our Court,
wrested from their temporising King, who abhorred
change, the sentence of Choiseul’s banishment, and
a deluge of blood was saved by his disgrace,—a merit
which our Court soon effaced by planning a war on
our American colonies, hoping to enslave them—and
by treating them with as much arrogance and obduracy
as they betrayed pusillanimity towards Spain
and France, with whom, by such blundering policy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
they drew on a war too; till, by misplacing haughtiness,
and by a series of wretched measures, they lost
at once our colonies in America, and the empire of
the ocean everywhere.</p>

<p>I return to Lord Weymouth’s resignation, who,
Lord Chatham’s friends asserted, had advised making
reprisals on Spain: whether authorised or prompted
by Wood, and whether to drive the resigner into
opposition, I know not. Certain it is, that he had
advised recalling Mr. Harris, our Minister, from
Madrid. Francés told me, that when Lord Weymouth
demanded restitution of the island, he had
promised to negotiate on the title; but when Spain
consented to the first point, Lord Weymouth affirmed,
he had only said that <em>then</em> we should be <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en
état de négocier</i>. The Spanish Ambassador maintained
that his Lordship had three times made the same
promise to him as to Francés.</p>

<p>For once such duplicity imposed on nobody; nor
did expected popularity follow. Could there be a
greater farce than the Bedfords acting jealousy of
national honour, when they knew our inability, and
had concurred in sacrificing our glory and interest
at the end of the most flourishing war? It was
only ridiculous that the Duke of Bedford cried out
for war, and opposed the land-tax that was to carry
it on! With equal consistence, that faction celebrated
Lord Weymouth for retiring <em>unplaced</em> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
<em>unpensioned</em>,—him, who ruined his tradesmen, paid
nobody, had sold a place that was <em>not</em> vacant, during
only six weeks that he was Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland,
and of which the purchaser could not recover
a shilling; and who had now obtained the Postmaster’s
place for his brother!—but could any good
come out of Nazareth?</p>

<p>On the 22nd the Parliament was adjourned for
the holidays; and on the 28th, a courier brought
advice of the Duc de Choiseul’s fall, of which I am
enabled to give some authentic anecdotes.</p>

<p>The Duke’s extreme indiscretion in keeping no
measures with Madame du Barry, the new mistress,
has already been mentioned. His folly was augmented
by having had the fate of his predecessor,
the Cardinal de Bernis,<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> before his eyes. The Cardinal,
from a starving, sonnet-making Abbé, had
been rewarded for his flatteries by Madame de
Pompadour with the red hat, and by being made
Prime Minister; both by her favour. He was no
sooner at the height of his fortune, than he not
only slighted her, but as an excuse for not visiting
her, pleaded that his rank in the Church forbade his
frequenting a woman of her character,—as if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
back stairs to the apartment of a kept mistress were
an honourable ascent for a priest, but her levée a
disgrace! His ingratitude and her revenge were
complete in about six weeks. The Duc de Choiseul,
who certainly was not often troubled with scruples,
and who had risen by the countenance of Madame
de Pompadour, now influenced by two women<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> of
characters as blemished as the mistress’s, affected
delicacy about Madame du Barry, who though a
common prostitute, at least had not the confidence
to act scruples. Yet, though she was the instrument
by which his ruin was effected, the crisis
turned on an affair of a public nature.</p>

<p>The Duc d’Aiguillon, a man as ambitious as
Choiseul, but of a nature as dark as the other was
frank and too boldly unreserved, had long been an
enemy of the Prime Minister. The Parliaments of
France, partly from contempt of the King’s weakness,
partly from the intrigues of Choiseul, who had
played them and the clergy against each other; and
yet more from that free spirit of thinking which
they had contracted from applying to English literature
and politics, and which Voltaire, Montesquieu,
and their modern philosophers, had brought
into vogue; the Parliaments, I say, had long given
much trouble to the Crown, and none more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
that of Bretagne, who, by the marriage of their
Duchess Anne with the Kings Charles the Eighth
and Louis the Twelfth, had obtained the strongest
confirmations of their privileges. Over that province,
Choiseul had set his competitor, D’Aiguillon,
with a view, it was believed, of destroying him by
the difficulty of managing that Parliament. D’Aiguillon’s
arbitrary nature, and his observation of the
aversion in which Choiseul was held by the Jesuits,
whom he had crushed, naturally threw him into the
arms of that society; but as the Parliament of
Bretagne had led the way to their destruction, the
presidents and councillors of that assembly could
not brook the countenance shown by their governor
to that odious society. At the head of the patriots
was the Advocate-General, La Chalotais; a man of
invincible spirit and intrepidity—of wonderful parts—of
integrity perhaps more wonderful—of some
vanity—and of no small indiscretion. Opposition
soon commenced, and soon grew inveterate between
two characters so dissimilar. The imprudences of
La Chalotais were immediately transmitted to
Court; and as his nature was unwary, his enemies
thought that whatever wore that impress would
appear natural; and accordingly there were no
follies so outrageous and improbable with which
they did not charge him. His business passed
through the hands of the Comte de St. Florentin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
afterwards Duc de la Vrillière, an ancient drudge
of office hackneyed in prosecutions and punishments,
and steeled to insensibility by a long series
of personal prosperity, and by being as long conversant
with the sufferings of others.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> To passive
insensibility he had learnt and added the tricks of
treachery; and being now connected with D’Aiguillon,
he easily circumvented the provincial credulity
of La Chalotais, and drew all his secrets from him
by a creature of his own, who acted the friend of
the Advocate-General, and went so far as to leave
(by a pretended mistake) an important letter he
had received from La Chalotais in St. Florentin’s
own room. The public did justice on the lower of
these tools, one Calonne, by hissing him in the
theatre. The King was so weak as to justify the
wretch publicly—which did but serve to make his
infamy more known; but on La Chalotais the
storm burst. He was dragged from prison to prison
with his son, and at last shut up with him, but in
separate dungeons, in the Château du Taureau, a
fort in the sea, to which there was access only at
low water. It was in a most rigorous winter, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
the son’s legs were on the point of mortifying. A
daughter of La Chalotais was hurried to a convent,
where she perished by continual alarms of her
father’s and brother’s deaths or approaching executions.
After repeated tyrannies and trials in various
places, many other Parliaments took up the cause
of the prisoners; the noble defences made by the
father, his undaunted braving of both his persecutors,
D’Aiguillon and La Vrillière, and above all his
and his son’s innocence, were so incontestable, that
Choiseul, struck with their virtues, or willing to
mortify D’Aiguillon, persuaded the King to stop all
proceedings. The victims escaped, though not acquitted;
and were banished, though not condemned.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></p>

<p>Their having escaped from the talons of power
and injustice was triumph sufficient to give new
spirit to their partisans. Grievous accusations
were heaped on the tyrant Governor, and much
indirect matter was thrown in. Plots of the
Jesuits, and some foolish meetings of them and
their devotees, were connected with the cause. A
madman was drawn in to charge the Duc d’Aiguillon
with having tampered with him to poison La
Chalotais; and it was confidently affirmed, even by
Choiseul’s intimate friends, that a scaffold had been
erected, and had not the Prime Minister had the
suspicious precaution of dispatching a third messenger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
with a reprieve by a private road, La Chalotais
had been executed, as the Governor had
interrupted and stopped two former messengers
sent by Choiseul for the same purpose. Of those
intrigues D’Aiguillon fully purged himself in print;
and of the last, Choiseul himself declared him entirely
innocent. As he could not, however, clear
himself of bitter tyranny, the public bated him
little of the whole charge; so that, finding himself
stand so ill in the eyes of a country which he aspired
to govern, he took the resolution of demanding a
public trial, and Choiseul took care it should not
be refused, which the other did not expect,—artifices
that by turns fell on both the artificers. The
Parliament’s inquisition growing unfavourable to
the great criminal D’Aiguillon, he flew for protection
to the mistress. She and their Cabal persuaded
the King to evoke the cause before himself
at Versailles,—a strange and unusual force put on
their free deliberations! They protested against
the violence. The King silenced all their proceedings
and all their remonstrances; a wound as fatal
to D’Aiguillon’s honour as to their privileges. The
Parliament threw up its functions.</p>

<p>At that period, Maupeou, the Chancellor, told the
King, that if he would dismiss the Duc de Choiseul,
the Parliament would submit, as it was the Minister
himself who secretly fomented their disobedience,—nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
was the charge improbable. But as fools
have more sympathy for fools, especially if the acting
fool has more cunning than the passive one, it was
the Prince of Condé<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> who persuaded the King to determine
on removing his Minister. Treachery drew
the dagger, but interest had whetted it. The Prince
was intimate with Choiseul, but wished to succeed
him as Colonel-General of the Swiss,—a view of
which a second treachery disappointed him. He
was the lover of the Princess of Monaco, who was
at law with her husband, and sued for a separation.
By the Parliament’s suspension of their functions,
her cause could not be heard. The Prince of Condé
told the King the Parliament would submit; he
told the Parliament the King would relax. They
resumed their functions, sat for a day before the
double imposture was discovered, gave sentence
for the Princess of Monaco; and then the Prince
of Condé, detected and disavowed by both sides,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
was banished to Chantilly; and at last entered
into the Cabal of the other Princes of the Blood,
and peers, who protested against the violence put
on the Parliament.</p>

<p>The Duc de Choiseul received many private
warnings of his approaching fate; but did not, or
affected not to apprehend it. On the contrary, he
gave out that he alone could make the peace, to
which Spain would consent solely from esteem and
consideration of him. He added, that the peace
made, he meant to retire. In the midst of this
delirium, or rather vaunt, the Duc de la Vrillière,
with tears as insincere as Choiseul’s tranquillity,
waited on him on the morning of the 24th of December
with a written order from the King, commanding
him to give up his post of Secretary of
State and Postmaster-General, and enjoining him
to retire to his seat at Chanteloup in Touraine, till
he should hear farther. The Duc de Choiseul
demanded if he might not delay till the following
Wednesday, that his house might be aired. As La
Vrillière hesitated, and seemed unwilling to bear
that message, the Duke wrote to the King himself,
and obliged the Minister to carry his letter. At
night a repeated order came to depart the very next
morning. “Ah!” cried Choiseul, “this is the drop
that makes the glass run over!” He set out the
next day with his wife and her physician. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
Duchesse de Grammont followed them on the Wednesday.
At Longjumeau, a little way from Paris,
several men of quality attached to him met him as
he passed, and the Duke, who had behaved with
great resolution, melted into tears. The Duchess,<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a>
all her life a heroine and philosopher, maintained her
dignity. She had often wished an end of her husband’s
Administration, and once at dinner professed
her desire of living retired with him; the Duchesse
de Grammont said brutally, “<span class="lote" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Reste à savoir s’il le
voudroit aussi lui.</span>” The company of that rival
sister was sufficient to embitter all the happiness of
living for ever with her beloved husband.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> The
Duc de Praslin was banished to his country-house.
Obscure officers were placed in their departments;
but months passed before the principal conspirators<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
assumed any authoritative posts. Paris swarmed
with libels and execrations on them, the mistress,
and the King; and Choiseul became adored, because
his enemies were detestable or contemptible.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></p>

<p>The deplorable state of the navy, set forth in
the most melancholy colours by the Opposition,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
had raised so much discontent, that on the 9th of
January, Sir Edward Hawke, almost fallen into a
state of imbecility, found it necessary to resign his
command of the Admiralty, which was immediately
conferred on Lord Sandwich, lately appointed Secretary
of State, in the room of Lord Weymouth.
The Admiralty, in which he had formerly presided
with credit, was the favourite object of Lord Sandwich’s
ambition; and his passion for maritime affairs,
his activity, industry, and flowing complaisance, endeared
him to the profession, re-established the
marine, and effaced great part of his unpopularity.
No man in the Administration was so much master
of business, so quick or so shrewd, and no man had
so many public enemies who had so few private; for
though void of principles, he was void of rancour,
and bore with equal good humour the freedom with
which his friends attacked him, and the satire of his
opponents.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
Before he quitted the Seals, a secret came out, to
which his acceptance of them gave occasion. Not
choosing to be dipped in the Spanish business, he
had taken the northern province, exchanging it for
the southern with Lord Rochford. The Spanish
Ambassador waited on the latter, to open with him
on the state of the negotiation. But how was the
Prince astonished when the Earl informed him, that
orders had been sent to Mr. Harris, our resident in
Spain, to leave Madrid immediately, if our last-sent
proposals should not be accepted! Directions were
given to him at the same time, to order our ships
directly out of the Spanish ports; and no modification
was allowed to Harris, but to take leave. The
Prince of Masserano exclaimed bitterly on this mysterious
and hostile step; said, he had been constant
in writing home accounts of the pacific disposition
of our Court, and now, when he expected a favourable
answer from Madrid, he learned what amounted
to a declaration of war! For himself, no man had
ever been used so ill: but, on his own treatment he
would not descant; the insult to his Court was so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
flagrant, that he declared, when the answer should
arrive, he would not deliver it, till he should know
how his master felt the recall of Harris. In this
just resentment he quitted Lord Rochford abruptly.
Francés, who was still here, and had not yet heard
of Choiseul’s disgrace, complained to Lord Rochford
of the indignity put on the Crown and Ambassador
of Spain, which the Earl endeavoured to soften and
explain away; but neither he nor Lord Sandwich
could defend the measure. The fact was, Lord
North had been seized with a panic on Lord Weymouth’s
resignation, who, he concluded, would vaunt
of having advised war; he had figured to himself
Lord Chatham, armed with national vengeance, and
the Opposition bellowing against his pacific inclinations.
Instead of striking the peace before any
obstructions could be given to it, he had obtained
from the Cabinet Council, four days after Lord
Weymouth’s retreat, the absurd direction to Harris
to leave Madrid,—a rash act, dictated by fear, and
from which nothing but Choiseul’s fall could have
extricated him. But fortune smiled on him, and
dissipated and disconnected all his enemies. At this
very time the Bedford faction lost their head. The
Duke died on the 14th, after having lived in a paralytic
state above a year.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> He left the care of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
successor, aged but five years, and the management
of his estate, to the Duchess, with whom were
joined his daughter, the Duchess of Marlborough,
and Mr. Palmer, his agent. To Rigby, his favourite,
he bequeathed 5000<i>l.</i> Lord Gower was
not mentioned in the will, probably from the hatred
borne by the Duchess to her sister-in-law, Lady
Gower, an intriguing, interested Scotch woman, as
eager as her husband to see him Prime Minister.
But the union of the party was much loosened by
the Duke’s death; nor did Lord North neglect to
strengthen himself against their Cabals. He offered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
the Seals of Secretary of State to the Earl of
Suffolk, a young man of thirty-two, totally unpractised
in business, pompous, ignorant, and of no
parts, but affecting to be the head of Grenville’s late
party. The young Earl answered with modesty, that
as he could not speak French, he was incapable of
treating with foreign ministers, nor was he conversant
in business; he wished for some high office,
but not that of Secretary; and recommended a few
of Grenville’s friends to preferment. He was appointed
Lord Privy Seal in the room of Lord Halifax,
Lord North’s uncle, to whom the Seals were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
given, though still worse qualified—for he knew
nothing, was too old to learn, and too sottish and
too proud to suspect what he wanted.</p>

<p>But they were the great employments of the law
which occasioned most remarks. Judge Bathurst,<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
one of the three Keepers of the Great Seal, for
which he had scarce been thought worthy, was
made Lord Chancellor, and created Lord Apsley, on
whose ignorance the profession punned, calling him
Lord <em>Absque</em>. De Grey succeeded Lord Chief
Justice Wilmot (who retired) in the Common Pleas;
Thurlow was appointed Attorney, and that abandoned
man Wedderburne,<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> Solicitor-General. The
last had certainly no superior in the House of
Commons for eloquence, readiness, argument, or
satire; nor in Westminster Hall for want of principles.
His politics, like his pleading, were at the
service of whoever offered him most.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<p>It was remarkable that the Earl of Guilford and
Lord Bathurst, fathers of the Prime Minister and
Lord Chancellor, were both living at this time.</p>

<p>Incensed as the Prince of Masserano had been at
the secret recall of Harris, Choiseul’s fall, and the
pacific disposition of the new French Ministers,
convinced him that his King had no assistance to
expect from France. His King, probably, from the
same reasoning, had relaxed some of his pretensions,
and sent powers to his Ambassador to terminate
his differences with us, before he was apprised of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
the orders given to Harris. The King of France
in the meantime prevailed on Masserano to communicate
those powers to our Ministers, engaging his
royal word to bear him harmless in case his master
should be offended with the recall, and with his own
Ambassador’s precipitation. Lord North, reassured
by Choiseul’s fall, and by the pacific sentiments of
France, of which the Duc d’Aiguillon had informed
Lord Harcourt, accepted the modification proposed
by Spain; and on January the 22nd, when the Parliament
reassembled after the recess, Lord Rochford
and Lord North notified to the two Houses,
that the Spanish Ambassador had that morning
signed a declaration relative to the expedition
against the Falkland Islands, which his Majesty had
been graciously pleased to accept, and which should
be laid before them on the Friday following. Mr.
E. Burke moved for a call of the House on that
day fortnight, to consider the declaration and acceptance.
The delivery of the declaration was
fortunate for peace, for two days after arrived a
positive order to the Spanish Ambassador to quit
this country without delay or excuse,—so offended
was the Court of Spain at the recall of Harris;
but the accommodation was signed, and the Prince
remained here.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> Nor had the threat of war been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
unfavourable to us; it had brought to light, and
consequently to correction, the nakedness of our
situation; and it had shown Spain and France how
soon we could prepare a force sufficient for our
defence,—at least, against any they were then able
to bring against us. On the pacification, Lord
Grantham, Vice-Chamberlain to the King, was
named Ambassador to Spain.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></p>

<p>The declaration of Spain imported, that his
Britannic Majesty having complained of the violence
committed on June the 10th, 1770, at the
island commonly called the Great Malouine, and by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
the English Falkland’s Island, in obliging by force
the commander and subjects of his Britannic Majesty
to evacuate the port by them called Egmont,
a step offensive to the honour of his Crown, the
Prince of Masserano, Ambassador Extraordinary of
his Catholic Majesty, had received orders to declare,
that his Catholic Majesty, <em>considering the
desire with which he is animated for peace</em>, <i>&amp;c.</i>, had
seen with displeasure this expedition, tending to
disturb it; and being persuaded of the reciprocity of
sentiments of his Britannic Majesty, &amp;c., his Catholic
Majesty did disavow the said violent enterprise,
and, in consequence, the Prince de Masserano declared
that his Catholic Majesty engaged to give
immediate orders that things should be restored in
the Great Malouine, at the port called Egmont, to
the state in which they were before the 10th of
June, 1770; for which purpose his Catholic Majesty
would give orders to one of his officers to deliver
up to the officer authorised by his Britannic Majesty
the port and fort called Egmont, with all the artillery,
stores, and effects of his Britannic Majesty and
his subjects, agreeable to the inventory that had
been made of them. The Prince of Masserano declared
at the same time, in the name of the King
his master, that the engagement of his said Catholic
Majesty to restore to his Britannic Majesty the possession
of the port and fort called Egmont, could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
not nor ought in anywise to affect the question
of the prior right of sovereignty of the Malouine
Islands.</p>

<p>This declaration was, as I have said, accepted, but
no notice taken on our side of the protest of prior
right. The act was, in truth, as appears on the face
of it, a mere temporary expedient to prevent present
rupture; Spain relinquishing no claim, nor expressing
a surrender of anything more than Port
Egmont—which we accepted with the air of a
sacrifice to which we had very slender pretensions.
Indeed, the worse the grace was with which we
seemed to accept the concession of Spain, the
greater in reality was our triumph; for though the
Opposition affected to decry our acquiescence, the
humiliation certainly fell on the King of Spain,
who yielded a flower of his crown, to which we
pretended no right but that of convenience and very
recent occupation; and which very convenience had
no meaning but that of an opportunity to annoy
Spain thereafter.</p>

<p>When the declaration was laid before the two
Houses on the 25th, Lord Chatham said he would
not discuss it then—it would take too many days.
It was only a compromise, only a war prorogued;
France not being ready to declare, had compelled
Spain to recede for the present. On the Duc de
Choiseul he made a strained panegyric, pronouncing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
him the greatest Minister that had appeared in
France since Cardinal Richelieu—that he was regretted
by all ranks of people in that country, and
would (he would venture to prophecy) be recalled!
As the portrait seemed to be intended for a resemblance
of himself, there was no doubt but he hoped
the prophecy, too, would be applicable to both. The
Duke of Richmond moved for all transactions with
Spain relating to the Falkland Islands, which Lord
Rochford promised should be brought; but Lord
Sandwich moved to restrict the question to such
papers only, not extending to any other matter,
which occasioned jealousy and debate. The Duke
then asked for all correspondence with France relating
to the same subject. Lord Rochford said,
not a word had passed through our Ambassador
(for all had been verbal, and negotiated with
Francés).</p>

<p>In the other House, Burke and Barré declaimed
against the pacification. They asked only for the
Spanish papers, which were granted. Some days
after, Mr. Seymour asked if any part of the negotiation
with Spain had passed through the Court of
France, and asked to see that correspondence, which
was refused by 173 to 57. Lord Chatham moved
the same day in the other House, that the Judges
should be ordered to attend on the morrow.</p>

<p>When the House met the next day, Lord Chatham<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
desired the two following questions might be
put to the <span class="locked">Judges:—</span></p>

<p>1. Whether, in consideration of law, the Imperial
Crown of this Realm can hold any territories or
possessions thereunto belonging, otherwise than in
sovereignty?</p>

<p>2. Whether the declaration or instrument for
restitution of the port or fort called Egmont, to be
made by the Catholic King to his Majesty <em>under
a reservation of a disputed right of sovereignty expressed
in the very declaration or instrument stipulating
such restitution</em>, can be accepted or carried into
execution, without derogating from the maxim of
law before referred to, <em>touching the inherent and essential
dignity</em> of <span class="smcap">the Crown of Great Britain</span>.</p>

<p>Lord Mansfield said, it was needless to refer these
interrogatories to the Judges, since the queries answered
themselves—meaning, the reply to both must
be negative; but it required more chicane to give
that negative, and at the same time to argue that
the questions did not fairly flow from the premises.
A vote of 69 to 22, refusing to refer the queries
to the Judges, supplied what was wanting in argument.</p>

<p>On the 8th, the Duke of Bolton moved to see
the instructions that had been given to Captain
Hunt when he was sent to the Falkland Islands; but
that demand was likewise rejected by 50 odd to 22.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
Those instructions had been so hostile, that Lord
Chatham owned he had hoped, if a Parliamentary
inspection of them could have been obtained, and
consequently publicity, that they would have provoked
Spain to break the new convention. On
this and the former debate Lord Chatham spoke
with infinite wit and much temper, and said, smiling
at the youth of Lord North and Lord Suffolk,
that old England was grown very old and decayed
indeed under so many young men!</p>

<p>This pacification cut up by the roots Lord Chatham’s
hopes, which had revived on the prospect of
war; but though the nation might have called for
the vigour of his spirited councils had war been declared,
nobody was desirous of making war only to
make him necessary,—especially when we had obtained
reparation of an insult to which we had given
the provocation. Wilkes did not wish Lord Chatham’s
exaltation, by whom he had ever been discountenanced
personally; and the Earl’s connection
with Lord Shelburne set him at still greater distance
from Wilkes, who, in truth, could but ill
maintain his ground at all, and had no support but
from the Common Council and the very mob. He
had, indeed, lately obtained an approbation of his
conduct from a majority of the Bill of Rights, but
composed of the least substantial members. Macleane,
one of his most noisy abettors in the House<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
of Commons, and who had lent him money, had
been bought off by the Court; on which Wilkes
abused him in the newspapers. Macleane obliged
the printer to discover the author, on which Macleane
challenged Wilkes, and he making no reply,
Macleane printed his challenge. Wilkes disavowed
the libels, and affirmed that he had declared as much
to a relation of Macleane, who had brought him the
latter’s defiance, which Wilkes waived as not being
the author of the abuse. Nor did the public think
well enough of Macleane to interest themselves in
his quarrel. Courage Wilkes thought he had displayed
sufficiently; and blemishes in his private character,
though set forth in the most odious colours
by his adversaries, he had found could not wean the
affections of the people. Yet his confidence in
that particular proved soon afterwards more detrimental
to his credit than all his former errors. Nor
did he take any pains to disguise what he thought
of his cause and his partisans; but with an ebriety
of indiscretion he would joke on his own situation
and adherents, even with men averse to his faction,
the Scotch excepted, whom he never spared.</p>

<p>Nor was his cause grown obsolete. New events
sprung out of it continually. To excite reflections
on Wedderburne, who had drawn up the Yorkshire
remonstrance, and was now Solicitor-General, Sir
George Saville moved for leave to bring in a bill,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
ascertaining that expulsion did not create incapacity.
He said he did not well know how to
make a complaint, where the House was both the
criminal and the judge, and when he himself was a
party. Wedderburne and Grenville’s friends evaded
the attack by voting for the motion, to prove their
consistence,—a step men in their situation never
take but when they have been inconsistent.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> The
motion was rejected by 167 to 103. The largeness
of the minority was owing to these temporary evasions,
and to the call of the House.</p>

<p>As the storm was blown over, the Duke of Richmond
moved the Lords to address the King to remit
pressing, unless the necessity still remained. Lord
Chatham made an artful speech on the state of
Europe, hoping to draw from the Ministers some
unguarded expressions. Lord Halifax opposed the
motion; but Lord Hillsborough fell into the snare,
and with great encomiums on Lord Chatham, confessed
he had long thought us in danger, and too
weak; feared the peace would not last, and declared
he had often pressed the other Ministers to increase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
our force. Lord Craven<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> asked him, Why then had
he opposed a motion for that purpose but last
March? Lord Chatham said, he now saw the motion
was improper, for the Ministers owned the
peace would not last; and he begged the Duke of
Richmond to withdraw his motion. Lord Gower,
thinking that assurance was the only remedy for
indiscretion, denied point-blank that Lord Hillsborough
had confessed any weakness or apprehensions;
and Lord Suffolk, maintaining that the House
was in possession of the question, and that it could
not be withdrawn without leave, the Court Lords
would have forced a division, but the Opposition
would not vote.</p>

<p>The same day (Feb. 11), Sir William Meredith,
to favour the Duke of Portland, moved for a bill to
take a clause from the bill of Nullum Tempus,
which would assist the Duke’s pursuit of his cause;
but the taking away of which was thought would
be a singular hardship on Sir James Lowther. Lord
North had prevailed on Sir James to give up the
most exceptionable parts of that clause; yet the
latter was so obnoxious, that after a long debate,
leave was given by 152 to 123 for the bill to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
brought in.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> The Court party were furious against
the injustice, and seemed glad to be oppressed once,
as if one instance of partiality in their enemies
would wipe out all their own arbitrary attempts
and violences. They made all possible interest to
defend the clause; and Charles Fox, the phenomenon
of the age, undertook the patronage of it, and
gave as much satisfaction to the party as disgust to
the Opposition by the great talents he exerted on
the occasion: yet acrimony and Dunning’s abilities
prevailed that day (20th), and the bill was committed
by a majority of 15. Still the weight of
Lord Bute’s son-in-law effected what eloquence
could not; in seven days the tide turned, and the
bill was thrown out, by 164 to 154—a fair struggle
of partiality on each side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
On the 13th, the Spanish declaration was discussed
in the House of Commons. Lord Beauchamp
and Lord Palmerston moved the address of
thanks to the King. It was soberly worded, and
only thanked for the communication and acceptance
of peace. Lord North had softened the expressions
much more than those in the address of the other
House. This temperance prevented Dowdeswell
from making a string of motions, which he had
brought ready drawn; yet he harangued long. Forester,
though attached to Lord Gower, surprised
the House by pronouncing the address premature,
as the ratification of Spain was not arrived. The
debate lasted till past three in the morning, though
unanimated. Barré was lively, Burke ill-heard, and
Dunning tedious. Colonel Burgoyne made a fine
set speech against the peace; and Lord Irnham,
father of Colonel Lutterell, all zealous courtiers,
voted against the address, but it passed easily.</p>

<p>The Duke of Newcastle<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> moved the address the
next day in the Lords. Lord Camden opposed it,
and was answered by Lord Mansfield. Lord Chatham
spoke for two hours, but languidly and ill;
Lord Shelburne better than he had ever done.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
But it was Lord Weymouth on whom all expectation
hung: he expressed himself with much obscurity
and mystery. He was understood to mean,
that the Lords in Opposition had vainly tried to distinguish
between what <em>he</em> had demanded, and what
was now obtained; but that there was no material
difference. He said he had, throughout the negotiation,
told the Spanish Ambassador that he would
not hear any talk on the right. When he resigned,
he had looked on the treaty as broken off. His
reasons for resigning had been of a different nature,
and were such as he would not declare there.
The Duke of Richmond, stating what he thought
Lord Weymouth had said, in order, if possible, to
dive into his meaning, the latter desired to repeat
his own words, which, he said, had only been that
he would defend his own part of the negotiation;
that he had not said the present treaty did or did
not agree with what <em>he</em> had demanded—<em>that</em> might
be seen by his letters; that he would not hear <em>the
right</em> mentioned <em>before</em> the Declaration; and that he
could not help voting for the treaty as it now stood.
That his resignation had been dictated by other political
reasons, on which he had differed with his
brother Ministers. All this verbal shuffling spoke
nothing but treachery, irresolution, disappointment,
or discovery of the mistake he had made. Wood
did not scruple to confess to his friends that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
himself had made a gross mistake, and repented it
heartily; which could not but imply that he had
drawn Lord Weymouth into the same error. The
death of the Duke of Bedford had also lowered
their importance; Lord Gower had been sweetened
by the boon of the Duke’s Garter, and none of
the faction were willing to sacrifice themselves to
Wood’s blunder. Thus Weymouth was reduced to
resort to the clemency of the Court, and to the
occasion it might have for his narrow abilities hereafter.
The address was carried by a proportion of
90 to 30; and by more, when the Duke of Richmond
called for the proxies,—an usage, he said,
he did not like, but had been desired to practise
by Lord Rockingham, who was at Bath, and wished
to give his negative to the peace. Lord Temple
was not there, nor Lord Lyttelton, whose son-in-law
Anglesey’s cause was pending, and made
him fear to offend.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> Lord Hardwicke voted for the
pacification, and continued on that side, though he
had treated his brother, the momentary Chancellor,
so inhumanly for accepting the Seals but the last
year. A protest of vast length was drawn up, and
signed by sixteen peers. Lord Radnor signed a
short one by himself.</p>

<p>The danger of war was no sooner blown over,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
than the Ministers precipitated themselves, though
not unwarned, into a new difficulty, which, had it
been conducted by the Opposition with the same
address with which it had been planned, might have
produced very serious consequences. The scheme
was laid by Wilkes, who had far more enterprising
invention than judgment, and was a better leader of
hussars than a general. Assured of the juries in
the City of London, he pushed on the printers to
hazard all lengths, both in abuse and in publishing
the debates with the names of the several speakers,—a
liberty always deemed by Parliament a breach of
privilege. But he did not solely depend on the
perseverance of the London juries in acquitting
libellers. The City pretended to exemption from
the jurisdiction of the House of Commons, founding
their claim on the restitution of their Charter by
King William, which had been taken away by
Charles the Second, though King William did no
more than restore their ancient rights; but they
arrogated their immunity from grants of ancient
Kings. Secure of the attachment of Crosby, the
Lord Mayor, Wilkes hoped the House of Commons
would embroil themselves with the City, where he
knew their authority would be resisted. Hints of
this plot had been conveyed to Lord North many
months before, and yet he had not the caution to
avoid it. The two George Onslows, the elder very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
indiscreet, the younger very intemperate, were,
from being the friends and champions of Wilkes,
become his inveterate foes; and between wantonness
and design, he daily inflamed their anger. A
complaint being made to the House of the licentious
freedom practised of printing debates, Colonel
Onslow seized the opportunity of venting his rage
against a saucy paper in which he had been most
scurrilously treated. The printers of the debates
were ordered to attend, though not without opposition
and a division made by the Aldermen Townshend
and Oliver. To this order no obedience was
paid by the offenders; on which, the elder Onslow
moved, February the 19th, that they should be
questioned for contempt; but Lord North, who
generally leaned towards moderation, desired that
they might have allowance not to appear till the
next day, which was agreed to; but as they continued
to abscond, the House voted that if the
summons were delivered at their own houses, it
should be regarded as if they had been delivered to
the printers in person. The House also addressed
the King to order them to be taken into custody;
and their contumacy not ceasing, it was carried on
the 25th by a majority of 160 to 17, that they
should be taken into custody.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> This was what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
Wilkes had aimed at, and the consequences will
appear presently.</p>

<p>About this time happened a considerable change
in the Court of Denmark. The King, a weak
and capricious little mortal, had early conceived a
marked aversion for his Queen, the youngest sister
of England, and had disgraced their cousin, the
Prince of Hesse, for espousing her cause; as did his
grandmother, the first Queen Dowager. Bernsdorffe,
his Prime Minister, was devoted to the
Court of Russia, and during the King’s absence in
England and France, the Russian Minister had
treated the Queen with great want of respect. As
she was of a dauntless spirit, she took upon her
to order him to quit Denmark; and on the King’s
return, feeling his incapacity and her own courage,
she assumed such an ascendant over him, that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
not only got rid of his favourite, young Count
Holke, but, aided by the King’s physician, who was
thought to be equally dear to both their Majesties,
she dismissed Bernsdorffe and all the old Ministry,
flung herself into the French faction, and transferred
the whole power of the government to the
beloved physician, Struensee. These despotic acts
were accompanied by many extravagances, and
more scandal. She reviewed the troops in a masculine
habit, and when she went to meet her
mother, the Princess of Wales, was dressed in
regimentals with breeches of buckskin, though of
enormous corpulency. The Princess lamenting to
her the fall of Bernsdorffe, the ancient servant of
the family, the Queen of Denmark said, “Pray,
madam, allow me to govern my own kingdom as I
please!” Such early haughtiness was no omen of a
tranquil reign.</p>

<p>On the 4th of March a bill was moved for in the
House of Commons by Sir George Colebrooke,<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
allow the East India Company to maintain here a
regiment of two thousand men, for supplying recruits
to the defence of their settlements. It was
to be composed of foreign Protestants. The matter
was debated without partiality, the Ministry affecting
to take no part in it, and Lord North not
attending the discussion. Yet, if he stood neuter,
the Scotch faction at Court were far from indifferent
to the scheme. Sir Gilbert Elliot,<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> in a fine studied
oration, supported it with all his abilities; Dyson
laboured it, and it was carried to commit the bill.
One Stewart, a Scot, was destined for colonel; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
I myself heard the Duke of Argyle and Lord
Frederic Campbell exulting on the success, and
congratulating one another <em>that the King would at
least have another regiment at his command</em>,—a point
of view which numbers of our northern brethren
kept ever in their eye.</p>

<p>The Court was not less triumphant in Ireland,
where the Parliament had at last been suffered to
meet. Lord Townshend during its long vacation,
had employed such effectual corruption, that when
the Opposition injudiciously contested an usual
address to the King to thank him for their Lord-Lieutenant
(the more likely to pass as no money
was asked), the Court had a majority of twenty-five
votes. Next morning, a body of weavers rose and
assaulted the complaisant peers,<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> on which the
Lords would not report the address, but sent to the
Lord-Lieutenant to demand guards, that their members
might attend and vote in safety. The like
address having passed the Commons, Mr. Ponsonby,
their Speaker, resigned the chair, rather
than carry it to the other House. This step was
imputed to a panic he was believed to have felt,
from an idea that Lord Townshend had got evidence
of his having instigated the tumult, though
he himself ascribed it to the Viceroy’s having reflected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
on the House of Commons the last year.
Lord Townshend not having interest enough to
name a Speaker to his mind, was forced to prefer
Perry to a more obnoxious man, though Perry was
a very able man, not well-disposed to the Court,
but thoroughly attached to the interests of Ireland.
These clouds obliged the Lord-Lieutenant,—though
he had declared the Parliament was called to carry
on private business, not for the purpose of giving
money,—to determine that it should rise in a fortnight.
As the King of France was more despotic,
he at this time annihilated the Parliament of Paris,
and established six superior councils in its room.</p>

<p>Dowdeswell, on the 7th, moved for a bill to
ascertain the duty of juries, but Dunning and others
of his own party opposed it, apprehending danger
from meddling with that great palladium of liberty;
so that, except General Conway, who out of candour
said a few words, not a man in the Administration
spoke, and the motion was rejected by 160
to 40.</p>

<p>On the 12th of March six more printers were
denounced to the House of Commons for printing
their debates; and two more were committed to
the Black Rod by the peers, for reflections on the
Lords of the Bedchamber, by whose votes Lord
Pomfret had carried a cause on an appeal. It was
for a considerable estate which had been given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
against him in Yorkshire by a jury of the most
unbiassed and reputable gentlemen of the county,
who had transported themselves to the spot, and
examined all circumstances with scrupulous exactness.
The Earl, who was in truth little better than
a lunatic, had treated their decision with the utmost
indecency and violence, and trusting to his
favour with the King, for whom he was a kind of
Don Quixote, had brought an appeal to the House
of Lords. That judicature was of signal reputation
in cases of property, though almost always led by
the two or three law Lords of their own body: yet
in Lord Pomfret’s case, though the Ministers said
not a word, and though Lord Camden spoke against
him, the cause was given for the Earl by the notorious
partiality of the Court Lords. The badness
of the cause was so flagrant, that Dunning, who
pleaded for Lord Pomfret, having persuaded the
Duke of Manchester, a peer in Opposition, and
one or two more, to decree for the Earl, confessed
he was shocked at having convinced them.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
Earl himself treated the lawyers with great virulence;
and as if his intellects recommended him,
or the hardship of his case called for still farther
protection, the King, during the litigation, made
him a Privy Councillor. The Lords committed
Woodfall, the printer, to Newgate, and fined him
100<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The House of Commons was more refractory, and
sat till five in the morning on the commitment of
the printers, the Opposition battling on every individual,
and moving after every question to adjourn;
so that, after three and twenty divisions, they
wearied out the patience of the Ministers, who at
last yielded to order the printers to attend on the
14th. This perseverance was the work of Charles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
Turner<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> of Yorkshire, the two Burkes, the Aldermen
Townshend and Oliver, and five more of the Opposition,
who alone remained in the House against
seventy courtiers.</p>

<p>But delay was not the only defensive weapon
used by the offenders. John Wheble, one of the
printers, had been ordered to attend the House of
Commons by a messenger sent to his house. He
paid no obedience to the summons, but taking
counsel of Robert Morris, a lawyer and warm
member of the Bill of Rights, who alleged many
informalities and invalidity against the warrant,
which was not even signed by the Speaker, Wheble
sent a contemptuous answer to the Speaker, both
on the warrant, and on a proclamation for apprehending
him, which by strange negligence had
appeared for three days in the Gazette without
being signed, which, in the opinion of the generality
of the law, made it to be deemed of no force.</p>

<p>On the 14th the Commons sat again till half an
hour after four in the morning, when after being
teazed by thirteen more divisions, the Ministers
were glad to let off the printers after reprimanding
them on their knees.</p>

<p>On the 15th, Wheble was apprehended on the
strength of the proclamation by a person tempted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
by the reward, who carried him before Wilkes,
then sitting alderman; but Wilkes instantly discharged
him and bound him over to prosecute his
accuser, though giving the apprehender a certificate
to entitle him to the reward from the Lords of the
Treasury.</p>

<p>The same evening, Miller, printer of the <i>London
Evening Post</i>, against whom another proclamation
had been issued, was taken into custody by a messenger
of the House of Commons; but refusing to
attend the messenger, was seized by him by the
arm; on this, Miller sent for a constable, and gave
him charge of the messenger for assaulting him in
his own house. The constable carried the messenger
before the Lord Mayor, and a hearing of
the cause was had before the Mayor and the
Aldermen Wilkes and Oliver.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Serjeant of the House of
Commons being informed of the transaction, went
and demanded the bodies of the messenger and
Miller. The Mayor asked him if he had applied
to a magistrate to back the warrant, or to any
peace officer to assist him, to which he answered,
No. The Mayor said no power had a right to seize
a citizen of London without authority from him or
some other magistrate, nor should while he held
that office; and that he thought both the warrant
and seizure illegal, and therefore declared Miller<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
to be at liberty. The assault on Miller being
proved, the Lord Mayor told the messenger he
must give bail, or be committed to prison. At first
he refused, but the commitment being made out,
and signed by the Mayor and the two Aldermen,
the Serjeant-at-arms offered bail for the messenger,
and he and his sureties were bound for his appearance
at Guildhall at the next session.</p>

<p>Such high attacks on their authority roused the
House of Commons, and startled the Ministers. A
junto of seven was held at Lord North’s, when the
ruling spirit was moderation. At a larger meeting
the next night, the same temper or fear appeared
in most of the assembly, particularly in Rigby,
who had not forgotten that his loss of a former
place had dated from the contest on general warrants;
but Sir Gilbert Elliot, the oracle or mouth
of the secret Cabal, pressed for firmness and penal
measures. The elder Onslow, as he told me himself,
offered at that council to prevail on his cousin
to drop the prosecution of the printers; but though
the Ministers would not enjoin them to proceed,
they assured the elder that they would support him
and his cousin, if they went on with the complaint.
On this <span class="locked">encouragement,—</span></p>

<p>The affair was discussed on the 18th;<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
Rockingham party, instead of seizing so popular a
topic of clamour, were, as usual, cool in the wrong
place, and rather zealous for maintaining the dignity
of the House, without inquiring previously whether
the House was founded in its pretensions. If not,
to maintain what they had done, only because they
had done it, would be an argument equally for
supporting tyranny or the inquisition, if once established.
Even the younger Burke was zealous
against the Lord Mayor. Lord George Germaine
spoke to the same purpose, but the superiority of
his understanding made it suspected that his view
was solely aimed at embarking Lord North in a
quarrel with the City and its magistrates. Charles
Fox, as if impatient to inherit his father’s unpopularity,
abused the City as his father used to do;
but the Ministers were moderate, and Conway
much so, though against sacrificing the honour of
the House. Rigby went farther, and in hopes the
affair would drop, proposed to put it off for some
days. As the Lord Mayor was confined with the
gout, Sir W. Meredith, Sir John Griffin, and Conway
pleaded for allowing him farther time; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
the courtiers divided against and rejected that motion;
yet afterwards Lord North himself proposed
to insert, in the order for his appearance on the
morrow, the words <em>if he is able; if not, on the
Friday</em> following, which was agreed to.</p>

<p>Alderman Oliver, who was present, not only declared
he had signed the warrant for committing
the messenger of the House, but declared he had
advised it; yet no notice was taken. Sir Joseph
Mawbey, in hopes of bringing Wilkes at the head
of a mob, moved twice to call him, too, before
them; but the Ministers dreaded his appearance,
and would not join in the motion. Alderman
Townshend, in hatred to Wilkes, who had planned
these difficulties, absented himself from the House:
thus the selfish factiousness of Lord Shelburne, and
the injudicious candour of Lord Rockingham and
his friends, split the Opposition into impotent
Cabals, and soon accomplished their own annihilation.</p>

<p>It was remarkable, that Lord Halifax was again
become Secretary of State, and that as such was
again embroiled with Wilkes, who sent him word
that he had discharged Wheble. It was well said,
that in this contest Colonel Lutterell must vote
with the majority of the House, for <em>they</em> were <em>his</em>
constituents.</p>

<p>The next day the Lord Mayor, though labouring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
under the gout, attended the House. He was escorted
by a thin concourse of people, though thousands
of hand-bills had been dispersed to invite a
mob. He told the House that he had little to say;
that he had done his duty according to his oath, and
did avow the charge. For himself, this was all he
had to say; for the City, he demanded to be heard
by counsel. The Charters of the City he desired
might be read, which was complied with. After an
hour and a half he grew so ill that he asked leave
to retire, which was granted, and the matter was
adjourned till the following Friday. Dunning moved
to grant the City counsel, which Thurlow opposed;
but it being observed that the whole affair was adjourned,
it was then dropped.</p>

<p>Lord North moved to send for the City’s book,
that they might expunge the messenger’s recognizance
and discharge, which was opposed, but ordered.
An incident, more memorable, perhaps,
than the business itself, from the secret it brought
to light, or rather authenticated, followed next.
Charles Fox, with his usual intemperance, moved
to examine Alderman Oliver the next day, whom
he should consider, he said, in a public light, as an
assassin of the constitution. Colonel Barré (for Oliver
had retired with the Lord Mayor) said, it became
no man to call another assassin, who assassinated
that person behind his back. Fox, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
same violence replied, When he was a boy at school,
he remembered nothing so well as the clamour
against Barré for assassinating Mr. Pitt behind his
back.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> To that attack Barré returned this thundering
sentence: “If the gentleman would go <em>home</em>,
he might learn the name of the person who set me
upon that assassination, which I now so much abhor,”
and of which Lord Holland<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> had always been
suspected, and was now proved to be the instigator.
Nor was this the whole that came out; for Barré
now told several persons that Lord Chatham had,
on their reconciliation, acquainted him, that on the
very day of Barré’s second attack on him, Lord
Holland had hurried out of the House after him,
and had said, he hoped he did not think that he
(Lord Holland) had any hand in encouraging the
outrage, in which he vowed he was not concerned.</p>

<p>On the 20th, Sir Joseph Mawbey offered to the
Speaker a letter from Wilkes, which the Speaker
refused to receive; but Mawbey read a copy of it,
which he said should be part of his speech; but
Lord Strange denied he could make it so, as he
had said he did not know the contents: nor would
the House attend to it, though he did read it,—so
afraid were they of being embroiled with Wilkes.
Sir Gilbert Elliot and the Scotch, seeing the weakness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
of the Opposition, had undoubtedly pushed on
this affair as a decisive blow; but the King now
grew frightened, and owned he wished it over,
though Lord Rochford endeavoured to keep up his
resolution, and Charles Fox affected to lead the
House, till even Wedderburne asked if Fox was
the Minister. The House then sent for the Lord
Mayor’s book, and tore out the messenger’s recognizance.
To the City<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> they allowed counsel, but
tied up their hands by restraining them from speaking
on the privileges of the House. Wedderburne,
having been reflected on in the course of the debate,
made a defence of himself, in a most admired
speech, which would have excused his conduct, if a
speech could have done it. De Grey, member for
Norfolk, and elder brother of the Attorney-General,
besought the House not to make Wilkes and
Oliver of consequence, who were not of any. One
Evans, another printer, whom they had ordered
to attend, printed a letter, disclaiming their authority.</p>

<p>The same day Wilkes, for safety, removed from
his house in Westminster to lodgings in the City,
as Lord Shaftesbury did in the reign of Charles the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
Second. The Common Council thanked him, the
Lord Mayor, and Oliver, for the stand they made.
The Recorder made a sensible speech against that
motion, and refused to put the question for it;
but it was carried without him.</p>

<p>On the 22nd, the Lord Mayor excused himself on
his illness, for not attending the House. After a
debate of three hours, they determined to examine
Alderman Oliver, though the Lord Mayor could not
appear; and he was accordingly ordered to make
his defence on the following Monday. Lord North
said, he saw the Opposition wanted to protract the
affair, (which, in fact, was all they did attempt,) but
should not: he was very sorry the matter had ever
been stirred, but now must be gone through with.
His party were very clamorous for punishment, and
for vindicating the honour of the House,—and with
which the Opposition almost concurred, so far did
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> possess them. It is a standing
order of the House that breach of their privileges
must supersede all other considerations: on that
ground the Courtiers would suffer no other business
to proceed; while in the City a like <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">esprit de
corps</i> began to operate, even some of the Court Aldermen
beginning to favour their Mayor; but the
Opposition had not sense enough to avail themselves
of that disposition.</p>

<p>In the meantime a cloud seemed to threaten the
negotiation with Spain. The Prince of Masserano<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
asked Lord Rochford abruptly, when we should cede
the Falkland Islands to them again? This seemed
to indicate a secret article of future restitution.
Lord Rochford said, “No minister would dare for
his head, to answer that question.” Monsieur Francés
owned that our Ministers had given no positive
promise of restoring the island, yet the greatest encouragement
to Spain to expect we would restore it.
Our Ministers, indeed, had positively declared in
Parliament, that there was no secret article in the
treaty;<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> yet this question of the Spanish Ambassador,
the declaration of Francés, and the dilatory slowness
of Spain, had much the air of dissatisfaction. Spain
is not like other countries, that raise their revenues
at home. Spain’s resources depend on the arrival of
their flotas from the West Indies. They had received
their galleons, and were prepared for two
years. As they forbore to send out another plate-fleet,
it looked as if the pacification was still incomplete.
Our Ministers, however, triumphing in having
avoided a war, set forth an exultation written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
by Dr. Samuel Johnson, and very abusive on the
Opposition, the Bill of Rights, Lord Chatham,
Junius, and the Lord Mayor, with most of their
names at length,—the very kind of grievance of
which the Court complained. With a lumber of
learning and some strong parts, Johnson was an
odious and mean character. By principle a Jacobite,
arrogant, self-sufficient, and overbearing by nature,
ungrateful through pride, and of <em>feminine bigotry</em>, he
had prostituted his pen to party even in a dictionary,
and had afterwards, for a pension, contradicted
his own definitions. His manners were
sordid, supercilious, and brutal, his style ridiculously
bombastic and vicious; and, in one word, with all
the pedantry he had all the gigantic littleness of a
country schoolmaster.</p>

<p>From the East Indies came bad news; a dreadful
famine had depopulated Bengal and swept away multitudes.
It was imputed in a great measure to the
servants of the East India Company, who, amidst
every species of tyranny and plunder, had monopolized
the chief aliments of the country.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> A ship
with three supervisors, who had been sent thither to
correct those horrible abuses, had been lost in its
passage.</p>

<p class="center b2">1771.</p>

<p>On the 25th the Lord Mayor attended the House.
He was now accompanied by a prodigious concourse
of people, who insulted both Lords and Commoners,
hissed Lord Rochford, and ill-treated Lord March
and George Selwyn, the latter of whom they mistook
for George Onslow. He collared and struck one of
the rioters, and was with difficulty saved from their
rage. The Lord Mayor told the House that he
had brought no counsel with him: first, because he
was cramped in his defence by their vote; and
secondly, because the two advocates he should have
chosen were gone the circuit. Ellis then moved a
resolution that the imprisonment of their messenger
by the Lord Mayor was a breach of privilege; but
before they could proceed farther, the Lord Mayor
was so ill that they suffered him to retire. The
debate, however, continuing, Sir George Saville
moved the previous question, because, the Lord
Mayor being restrained in his defence, it would be
a partial trial. This being rejected on a division of
272 to 90, Sir George, with six or seven of his
friends, protesting against their proceedings, walked
out of the House. Alderman Oliver was then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
called on; he adhered to his assertion of having
acted according to his duty, oath, and conscience.
The Ministers wished only to reprimand him; and
Sir John Wrottesley,<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> a young member, told him
the House would be contented if he would but say
he was sorry for what he had done; but he replied,
he had done what he thought right, and would do it
again. Sir Gilbert Elliot, whether to inflame his
offence, or to induce him to yield, repeated the
same offer—in vain. T. Pitt and James Grenville<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a>
the younger, who spoke with great applause for the
second time, endeavoured to moderate; but the
warm men prevailing, Colonel Barré rose and said
he would have nothing to do with such infamous
proceedings—that no <em>honest</em> man could sit amongst
them, and walked out of the House with four or
five more. At that moment arrived Alderman
Townshend, pale and ghastly from a sick-bed, his
hair lank, and his face swathed with linen, having
had his jaw laid open for an inflammation. He said
directly that all those arbitrary proceedings were
owing to the baneful influence of the Princess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
Dowager of Wales, and that he would move for an
inquiry into her conduct. Yet all these insults could
not dismount the passive phlegm of the Ministers;
Lord North alone said, that Townshend could not
know the truth or falsehood of his assertion, and
for himself, in five years that he had been in the
Administration, he had seen no influence of the
Princess. At four in the morning they sent Alderman
Oliver to the Tower, and ordered that the
Lord Mayor should attend them again on the 27th.</p>

<p>Still would not Wilkes obey their summons, nor
did they dare to force him before them. Sir Joseph
Mawbey again pressed it, but Lord North shuffled
it off by saying Wilkes was so desperate that what
would be punishment to others, would be an advantage
to him. The courtiers repeated this, but it
only displayed their timidity; and happy was it for
the constitution that so much pusillanimity reigned
in their conduct. Yet the Scotch wanted to come
to blows, and were at least not sorry to see the
House of Commons so contemptible.</p>

<p>But the victory which the Court did not dare to
push over Wilkes, his rash and abandoned conduct
threw into their hands. Shelburne’s faction, covertly
under Townshend, and undisguisedly under
Horne, was warring with him in the midst of their
common attack in the House of Commons. The
Society of the Bill of Rights happened to be adjourned;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
Horne and his partisans summoned a
special meeting to reward the persecuted printers,
and voted a sum of money to them. Wilkes, as if he
grudged that any money should be expended but on
himself, advertised against this step, as the measure
of an irregular meeting. His antagonist replied,
and published the names on each side, which proved
not to be twenty on either, and all men most inconsiderable.
This not only brought disgrace and
ridicule on the Society, but fell more fatally on the
credit of Wilkes than all his persecutions, all his
follies, or all his vices, and was the destruction of
his popularity itself, which became confined to the
very dregs of the people. His old patron, Lord
Temple, retaining his constancy to faction, though
broken with all factions, immediately visited Alderman
Oliver in the Tower.</p>

<p>The Lord Mayor went again to the House on the
27th at the head of a prodigious mob, who, meeting
Lord North, attacked him with a rage that had
all the appearance of being premeditated. They
punched a constable’s staff in his face, and endeavoured
to tear him out of his chariot, which they
entirely demolished.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> Sir William Meredith, a
generous enemy, and Mr. La Roche, a friend, seeing
his danger from the window of a coffee-house, went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
down and rescued him from the mob.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> The two
Foxes were as rudely handled, and escaped as narrowly.
Vast numbers of constables were sent for,
but it was late in the evening before the tumult subsided;
nor would the Speaker suffer the business of
the House to proceed till all was quiet. Wedderburne
told the House it had been a riot headed by
the magistrates. Lord North made a firm speech,
and took notice of a report that he had resigned,
and was to be succeeded by Earl Gower; but said
he should be the meanest man living, if he quitted
at that juncture; nor would he quit till his Majesty
should dismiss, or the people tear him to
pieces. Lord Hinchinbrook,<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> in answer to his uncle
Seymour, who had spoken with violence, was so
indecent as to betray a secret,—that Seymour, in
Grenville’s Administration, had asked to be Vice-Chamberlain,
and imputed his animosity to having
been refused that office. Yet, in general, both
parties behaved that day with moderation. The
Ministers moved that the Lord Mayor should, on
account of his bad health, be committed only to
the custody of the Serjeant-at-arms; but he, rising
up, scornfully declared he was as well as ever, and
chose to be sent to the Tower with his brother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
Oliver. Temper could operate no farther, and at
twelve at night he was committed to the Tower.
The Ministers then proposed to elect, and did elect,
by ballot, a committee to consider of the resistance
given to the orders of the House, and of the means
of redressing it. Rigby, who was named for one,
refused to be of it; and he and his friends took
pains to show they would not engage in the quarrel.</p>

<p>The Lord Mayor went for a few hours to the
Mansion House. The mob meditated hanging Clementson,
the Deputy Serjeant-at-arms, who conducted
him, on a sign-post, and the poor man heard
them debating on it; but the Lord Mayor with
difficulty obtained his safety by representing that he
was not a principal, but acting in quality of servant
to the House. At four in the morning the Mayor
went to the Tower, where the Common Council
voted that tables should be kept for him and Alderman
Oliver. Brass Crosby, the Lord Mayor,
was originally a low attorney, and had married his
master’s widow, and afterwards the widow of a
carcass-butcher. With their fortunes he trafficked
in seamen’s tickets,—a mean and disreputable kind
of usury. Nor were his manners more creditable
than his professions. When he entered the Tower
he was half drunk, swore, and behaved with a jollity
ill-becoming the gravity of his office or cause. Had
his behaviour been solemn or dignified, the novelty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
of the City’s chief magistrate imprisoned in defence
of the City’s pretended franchises, might have made
a very serious sensation.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> Oliver, though decent,
was a young fellow unknown; nor had any of their
associates character or conduct sufficient to manage
a machine so important, which soon split into
squabbles, and fell to pieces without noise.</p>

<p>The House of Commons again ordered that
Wilkes should attend them on the Monday seven-night
after the holidays, not desiring he should
attend, but as if they meant to leave a precedent
which men of more spirit might follow hereafter.
Yet did they not adjourn till the Thursday in Passion
week, when they might have sent for him; but
they ordered their new committee to sit during the
recess.</p>

<p>On the 29th the King went to the House, was
violently hissed, and had an apple thrown at him,
which passed over his coach. Wedderburne was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
severely abused by Colonel Barré, and made a
wretched defence, pleading that he had not deserted
the Opposition but on the death of Grenville, to
whom alone he had been attached; but having
asserted that he knew taverns had been opened in
Westminster for the mob, and that he could prove
there had been men hired to make a riot, a committee
was appointed to inquire into the late disturbances,
of which Wedderburne was named chairman.
T. Townshend, jun., observed, that while the
Members were raging with such severity against
printers, a crown-living of 800<i>l.</i> a-year was conferred
on Scott, an abandoned priest attached to Lord
Sandwich, and author of “Anti-Sejanus,” “Panurge,”
“Cinna,” and many other most scurrilous libels.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></p>

<p>On the last day of the month Lord Rockingham,
with a train of Lords and Commoners in sixteen
coaches, went to the Tower to visit the Lord
Mayor. They disapproved his conduct, they said,
yet paid him that regard because he had been obstructed
from making his defence; yet these ingenious
persons wondered they had not more followers
and devotees, while they took such pains to show
how carefully they kept themselves out of difficulties,
and how passively they left their friends in
them!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
Alderman Oliver, in answer to a compliment
from the Common Council, wrote a very bold letter
to them, in which he set forth the unhappiness of
the King’s Government through the councils of an
Administration, <em>abject abroad and insolent at home</em>.</p>

<p>April the 1st, a great mob went to Tower Hill
with two carts, in which were figures representing
the Princess Dowager and Lord Bute, attended by a
hearse. The figures were beheaded by chimney
sweepers, and then burnt. A like ceremony was
performed a few days after with figures of Lord
Halifax, Lord Barrington, Alderman Harley, Lord
Sandwich, De Grey, member for Norfolk, Colonel
Lutterell, and George Onslow; and their supposed
dying speeches were cried about the streets.</p>

<p>The committee of Common Council, appointed
to guard the interests of the Lord Mayor and
Alderman Oliver, directed their solicitor to apply
to Serjeant Glynn, Dunning, or Lee, and under
their direction to move for the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">habeas corpus</i> of the
prisoners, unlawfully (as the committee conceived)
detained in the Tower. On this the two magistrates,
the writ being obtained, were carried before
the Lord Chief Justice De Grey, and then before
Lord Mansfield, but were remanded to prison by
both, each Chief Justice refusing to release them, as
they had been committed by Parliament then sitting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
The grand jury did not pay an equal deference to
the House, but found bills of indictment against
their messenger for the assault and false imprisonment
of Miller, the printer; and against Edward
Twine Carpenter for a like assault on John Wheble,
under pretence of the King’s proclamation.</p>

<p>Still the cause of the magistrates did not gain
ground. The merchants were offended at a report
spread by Wilkes’s faction that there was a run on
the Bank. But an open quarrel between Wilkes
and Horne contributed more than all the efforts of
the Court to ruin their cause. The total breach
happened at the Society of the Bill of Rights,
which Horne moved to dissolve, but was overruled
by 26 to 24. Horne, however, with Townshend,
Sawbridge, and others, withdrew their names, because
the other faction would not consent to
rescind the vote of restricting the subscription to
the payment of Wilkes’s debts. A motion, too,
that was made in the company of City Artillery,
for thanking the imprisoned magistrates for their
behaviour, was rejected by a majority of three
voices.</p>

<p>Still, had the Opposition had sense or union, the
weakness of the Ministers would have opened a
fair field to their attempts. They adjourned over
the day appointed for Wilkes’s appearance. Their
two committees came to nothing. Lord George<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
Germaine, Lord John Cavendish, and Frederick
Montagu, whom out of candour they had added to
the quorum, would not attend it, nor even a sufficient
number of their own friends; nor though
Thurlow and the stauncher courtiers suggested bills
of pains and penalties, and would have disabled
the prisoners from holding any office, would Lord
North give in to any violence. As he had been
more severe before he was a principal, and as he
gave other subsequent proofs of wanting resolution,
his moderation was, with some justice, imputed to
timidity.</p>

<p>On the 10th of April, when Lord North opened
the budget, T. Townshend reflected on Lord Holland
as author of the proscriptions at the beginning
of the reign. Charles Fox said he did not believe
his father had any hand in them; but if he had, it
was right to break the power of the aristocracy
that had governed in the name of the late King.
Charles Fox asked me afterwards in private if the
accusation against his father was just. I replied, I
could not but say it was. In strict truth, heavy as
the reproaches were that were cast on the Court,
there was but too much foundation for them. Even
the King’s virtues had a mischievous tendency.
His piety was very equivocal, and calculated, in a
great measure, to secure the influence of the clergy,
and palliate his despotic views. His economy, such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
as it was, for great sums he wasted childishly, was
the forced result of the expense he was at to corrupt
the Parliament, and maintain a very unwilling
majority. He now laid aside his intention of building
a small palace he had begun at Richmond;
and deferred as long as he could an installation of
Knights of the Garter, and the establishment of a
household for the Prince of Wales. Every post,
every office, that could be bestowed on the Scots
without immediate clamour, was heaped on them;
and great gratitude must at least be allowed to
them. They steadfastly supported the parts assigned
to them, and acted upon a regular plan. In the
beginning of the reign, Lady Charlotte Edwin, a
sort of favourite lady of the bedchamber to the
Princess of Wales, dropped this memorable expression
to me:—“<em>Things are not yet ripe</em>.” The
swarms of Scots that crowded and were gladly
received into the army and into the corps of marines,
a body into which few English deigned to
enlist, were no doubt placed there to bring things
to a maturity, or protect them when brought to it.</p>

<p>The care of the Prince of Wales was a trust no
less important. Two points only were looked to in
his education. The first was, that he should not be
trusted to anything but a ductile cypher; the
other, that he should be brought up with due affection
for regal power; in other words, he was to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
the slave of his father, and the tyrant of his people.
Praise is due even to those who execute ably their
own views, let those views be ever so bad. The
governors selected for the Prince were chosen very
suitably to the plan I have mentioned. The King
pitched upon Lord Holderness to officiate as the
solemn phantom or governor; Lord Mansfield recommended
Dr. Markham, the master of Westminster
School, a creature of his own, sprung out
of the true prerogative seminary, at Christchurch,
Oxford, a pert, arrogant man, to fill the post of
preceptor;<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> and thus was the heir of the Crown not
likely to degenerate. Lord North, the nominal
First Minister, had the mortification of finding that
he was rather a necessary than agreeable tool, for
he knew nothing of these designations till they
were ready to be notified to the public.</p>

<p>This arrangement had nothing in it but what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
was to be expected. That a man, the very reverse
of all those who were in favour at Court, should
have been admitted into this junto, was real matter
of surprise; and can only be accounted for by the
security of the King and his Cabal, in having
blocked up the chief avenues to the Prince. One
Jackson, an ingenious young man, recommended by
Lady Charlotte Finch, governess of the royal
children,<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> was named sub-preceptor;<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> but the person
at whom I hinted, and who was appointed sub-governor,
was Mr. Leonard Smelt, whose singular
virtues and character deserve to be recorded independently
of his office. He was younger son of a
gentleman in Yorkshire, and had a commission in
the Office of Ordnance, which he threw up, finding
no attention paid by his superiors to his representation
of many abuses there. He fell in love with
the niece of General Guest in Scotland, but retired
thence to avoid her, as he had not fortune sufficient
to maintain her. Another young lady, heiress to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
great wealth, conceived a passion for him, and obtained
her father’s consent before she acquainted
Mr. Smelt with her passion, which he had not suspected;—so
far from it, he swooned away with
surprise and concern, when the father offered him
his daughter. Mr. Smelt confessed his former engagement,
refused the lady, and again retired. Soon
after this his father died, and disinheriting his elder
son, who had disobliged him, bequeathed his whole
fortune to Leonard. The first act of this excellent
young man was to marry his beloved first mistress;
the second to settle half his fortune on his brother’s
children. His principles in public life were as
generous as in private; a steady friend to the constitution
of his country, he had signed the Yorkshire
remonstrance to the King against the intrusion
of Lutterell into the House of Commons.
His next introduction to his Majesty was as
sub-preceptor to his son: happy for the Prince had
he had no other governor—at least, no other director
of his morals and opinions of government! But
Mr. Smelt had neither authority to instruct his
pupil in matters of state, nor perhaps discernment
enough to baffle the insidious lessons of his associates,
for he was ignorant of the world as well
as of its depravity.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> Being a neighbour of Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
Holderness, the latter introduced him, and he was
received, notwithstanding his disqualification as a
patriot. The principles of a subaltern were believed
to be pliant. Lord Holderness himself owed
his preferment to his insignificance and to his wife,
a lady of the bedchamber to the Queen, as she did
hers to her daughter’s governess, whom the Queen
had seduced from her to the great vexation of Lady
Holderness. The governess, a French Protestant,<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a>
ingratiated her late mistress with the Queen, and
her mistress soon became a favourite next to the
German women.</p>

<p>While this new seminary of favourites was arranging,
those of the King were the objects of the
Opposition’s reproaches. In a debate on the 11th,
in which they were attacked, Sir Gilbert Elliot
defending them, gave occasion to an admired speech
of T. Townshend,<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> who, taking for his text that line
of <span class="locked">Pope:—</span></p>

<p>
“As Selkirk,<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> if he lives, will love the Prince,”
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
drew a severe picture of the Scotch favourites
under the character of Lord Selkirk, and applied
to them a still more bitter story of Lockart, Cromwell’s
Ambassador in France, who having acted in
that province under the Parliament and Oliver,
and being at last employed on a like commission by
Charles the Second, Cardinal Mazarin taunting
him with this versatility, and asking him from
whom he came then, he replied he was <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">le serviteur
des évènemens</i>.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> <em>The King’s friends</em>, said Townshend,
should not wear that title, but ought to call
themselves, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">les serviteurs des évènemens</i>. Sir Gilbert
Elliot took up the defence of <em>the King’s friends</em>,
and said, though all parties abused them, all had
courted them; and that Mr. Dowdeswell and his
connection on coming into power, had pressed them
to keep their places. Dowdeswell, with spirit not
usual to him, denied the fact, and told this anecdote.
When Lord Rockingham had meditated the
plan of a free port, Elliot, Dyson, and the King’s
friends declared against it. Still the Ministers had
persisted, and Cooper, Secretary of the Treasury,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
was ordered to move it, but came in a fright, and
said the friends would oppose it. Dowdeswell said
he had snatched the bill from Cooper, and had
added, he would be damned if they dared. He had
moved it; they had not opened their lips for or
against it, but had voted for it, and so they always
would if the Ministers had courage; but Lord
North, he saw, would not take enough upon him.</p>

<p>On the other side, Wilkes declared his intention
of standing for Sheriff of Middlesex the following
year, and applied to Alderman Oliver to join him
in that pursuit. Oliver declined the offer, saying
that his and Wilkes’s principles did not agree; and
added that himself and his brother had contributed
a tenth of the subscriptions for the payment of
Wilkes’s debts, which he thought sufficient, and as
the expense of the Shrievalty was a burthen in
common between both Sheriffs, he would not subject
himself to pay what Wilkes could not pay.
This was a new blow on the latter, and not
balanced by a gleam of applause paid to his imprisoned
Lord Mayor. The Burgesses of Newcastle
addressed him, and Bedford complimented
him with the freedom of their town. Worcester,
Stafford, Caermarthen, Pembroke, and Cardigan,
addressed both him and Alderman Oliver. The
Lord Mayor was carried by <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">habeas corpus</i> to the
Court of Common Pleas, but was remanded, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
Chief Justice, De Grey, declaring that the House
of Commons had authority over their own members.
Alderman Oliver was, at the end of the same month,
carried in like manner before the Barons of the
Exchequer, who remanded him for the same reason.</p>

<p>The reverse of fortune was falling on the Parliaments
of France, where their resistance on one
hand, and the bold despotism of the Chancellor
Maupeou on the other, had brought things to extremities.
Maréchal Richelieu in the King’s name
dissolved the Cour des Aides; fifty <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mousquetaires</i>
had been sent to the members of that court with
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">lettres de cachet</i>, ordering them to be assembled in
their court by seven o’clock the next morning, with
injunctions not to debate or protest, but to await in
silence his Majesty’s commands. Ordinarily, the
princes of the blood were charged with those commands;
but forms were not observed when fundamentals
were annihilated. Richelieu was selected,
and arriving, would have placed himself in the seat
of the First President, but the members opposed,
and said none but princes of the blood had a right
to that place. He insisted; they declared they
would withdraw; he gave it up and took a lower
seat. A counsellor who had accompanied the
Maréchal then harangued on the King’s power, and
on what did not appear quite so self-evident—on
the King’s goodness; and then read an edict suppressing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
that council, become useless, he said, by
the new establishment of six superior councils.
This was palliated by a declaration that the King
did not propose to lay aside men of their merit; on
the contrary, he invited them to enter into his new
Parliament. The Advocate-General replied to this
fine harangue, urging that none of his brethren
could take a part in a Parliament that must always
be illegal, as he proved by the laws and constitutions
of the kingdom. The Maréchal, then rising,
ordered the members to retire, which they refused
to do; he threatened to force their obedience.
They replied, it was not their profession to fight,
that they must submit to force, and withdrew. Ten
of them were banished ten leagues from Paris.
The King then held a bed of justice at Versailles,
to which were summoned the Princes of the Blood,
the Dukes and Peers, and the Grand Council. The
Princes disobeyed and would not attend,—all but
the Comte de la Marche, only son of the Prince de
Conti, who, being at variance with his father, adhered
to the King. The Grand Council were
reinstated and converted into a Parliament in the
place of that dissolved. The King declared this
was his will, and that he should never change it.
Twelve Dukes, among whom were even Maréchal
Richelieu’s own son, Fronsac, and the courtly Nivernois,
protested against this proceeding. The Princes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
of the Blood were forbidden the Court for their disobedience;
the twelve Dukes were only frowned
upon.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> I shall resume this subject again before
the end of the year.</p>

<p>The Court of Spain now notified to us that they
were satisfied of our pacific intentions, and should
disarm. Orders were immediately given for our
doing the same. Thus the distractions in France
prevented a war for which the King of Spain was
personally eager.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of April the bill for raising an East
Indian regiment was, after many and long debates,
rejected. Lord North had taken no part in it, but
the officers had raised great objections to it, as preventive
of their recruiting; and General Harvey, a
favourite, had instilled those prejudices into the
King, heightened a little, probably, by Harvey’s jealousy
of Conway, who favoured the plan. Many
good men approved it likewise, as a method of putting
a stop to the infamous practice of kidnapping,
which was much used by the East India Company.</p>

<p>Two days after this, Serjeant Glynn presented a
petition to the House from Allen, the father of the
young man killed in St. George’s Fields, praying an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
inquiry might be made into that murder. Burke
and Dowdeswell supported the petition. Alderman
Townshend reflected on Sir William Meredith for
having interfered in behalf of the condemned chairmen,
and called it false lenity to murderers. Meredith
said, he hoped such lenity was allowable; that
it was at least as excusable as going about to stir
up murder on the score of party. Townshend said
in answer, that neither did he decline challenges—alluding
to Meredith’s not having answered a challenge
from Captain Allen. Lord Barrington excused
himself on the orders he had given to the
soldiers; and Colonel Onslow said the petition was
calculated to tell the people that they might mob
the Parliament. The motion was so stale, and the
charge of so ancient a date, that it was rejected by
158 to 32, though the House sat till eleven at
night.</p>

<p>On the 28th Alderman Sawbridge proposed a
bill for triennial Parliaments, but no attention was
paid to it, nor answer made by the Ministers. It
was rejected by 105 to 54, the Rockingham party
not liking the measure. Mr. Cornwall moved for
a prohibition of dispensing lottery-tickets to Members
of Parliament (a list of the receivers of which
was published); but this, as a decenter species of
corruption, was maintained by 118 to 31.</p>

<p>On the last day of the month the ministerial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
committee that had been appointed to consider on
the means of ascertaining the power of Parliament,
at last made their report; it was long, foolish, and
trifling, was universally ridiculed, particularly by
Burke, and ended there. They had wished to drop
it, but Sir Fletcher Norton, thinking it would inspire
some awe for the House—at least, to his person—threatened
to resign the Chair if at least some
effort at an opinion was not made. The other
committee, which Wedderburne had proposed and
headed, and from which he had promised great discoveries,
ended still more disgracefully in no report
at all! Sir George Saville treated him with much
scorn, saying, it was extraordinary that he who, two
years ago, could discover so many grievances, could
not at present produce one, though supported by all
the authority of Parliament.</p>

<p>On the first of May Lord Chatham moved one of
his tedious and obscure resolutions, tending to petition
the King to dissolve the Parliament, in order
to allay heats between the undefined rights of Parliament
and the magistracy (of London). He said
he saw the approaching destruction of liberty, and
would sooner go to Switzerland, America, or to
Constantinople, should it fall under the power of
Russia. The Chancellor, even Bathurst, answered
him with contempt—Lord Mansfield seriously—Lord
Sandwich sarcastically wishing him a good journey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
to Switzerland, and quoting the fate of an orator at
Geneva, whose brains had lately been knocked out
by a brickbat in a tumult there. The motion was
rejected by 72 to 22.</p>

<p>The 6th had been appointed for the Lords’ hearing
the appeal in the cause between Lord Chatham and
the relations of Sir William Pynsent, which had
been referred to the Judges. They came, prepared
to deliver their opinions, five on the one side and
three on the other. They were going to speak,
when Lord Mansfield suddenly arrived, and told
them a new idea had struck him, which he was sure
would reconcile their sentiments. He gave it; they
put up their papers, saying, they should all return
on the morrow of one opinion, and retired. On the
8th they concurred in Lord Chatham’s favour, and
the House decided accordingly.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></p>

<p>This proceeding was imputed to mean court or
timidity in Mansfield. In truth, this session had
been notoriously marked by partialities and personal
considerations. Lord Pomfret had carried
his cause by gross favour of the Court Lords.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> Lord
Mansfield, in compliment to Lord Lyttelton, whose
daughter was married to the pretender to the title
of Anglesey,<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> had gone great lengths to serve the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
latter, though in vain; and Lord Lyttelton had as
openly declined opposition to secure Lord Mansfield’s
patronage. Lord Camden, though more connected
with Lord Lyttelton, had carried himself
with less bias. The borough of Shoreham had been
unjustly punished by the House of Commons, who
opened the right of voting there to all Sussex,
because seventy members of what was called the
Christian Club had set their votes to sale, while
ninety innocent voters remained untainted. Lord
North, trusting the Lords would not confirm the
sentence, let it pass, but the Lords passed it too.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a>
A bill prohibiting divorced women from remarrying,
was thrown out by the credit of Lord Beauchamp
and Charles Fox. A bill for promoting
the navigation of Chester, and which had passed
the Commons, was rejected by the Lords, solely
because it would prejudice the Duke of Bridgwater’s
navigation; and Adam, the Scotch architect,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
was supported by the King and the Scots with
success against the City of London, on whose territory
and rights he had encroached with his new
buildings at Durham Yard, to which he and his
brothers gave the affected name of the Adelphi.</p>

<p>The session was to rise on the 9th of May, but as
the Lord Mayor and Alderman Oliver would <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ipso
facto</i> be at liberty the moment the Parliament was
no longer sitting, the King, for fear of the mob, who
would be assembled to escort the suffering magistrates
from the Tower, stole unexpectedly to the
House of Lords, made a very soothing speech, and
put an end to the session. The two prisoners were
conducted in ceremony to their houses; and at
night the City was much illuminated, but without
any tumult.</p>

<p>It is difficult to say which made the more contemptible
figure on this conclusion of the City’s
resistance,—the King and the House of Commons
on one side, or the Opposition and the City’s magistrates
on the other. The latter by disunion rendered
themselves ridiculous and insignificant; and
yet neither the Crown nor House of Commons
dared to take advantage of the neglect into which
the two martyrs were fallen. If the King comforted
himself with views of future aggrandizement
by the humiliations of the Opposition, it must be
owned that he bought those prospects with most disgraceful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
mortifications. Surely it had been more
glorious to have purchased the love of his people by
condescensions and reverence for the constitution.
It was pitiful consolation, and beneath the majesty
of ambition, to sit a tacit spectator of the persecution
of Wilkes by his friends, when all the artillery
of Government had been vainly employed to fulminate
so worthless a man!</p>

<p>No sooner was the session at an end, than the
paper war which had been carried on anonymously
between Wilkes and parson Horne, broke out under
their respective names with redoubled violence.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a>
They told all they knew of each other, and yet proved
nothing but little tricks, foolish vanities, and suspicions
of each other. Men wondered they had nothing
worse to say. Horne appeared to have scarce
any parts, and Wilkes not much better. These
peevish jarrings diverted them from exposing and
making advantage of the weakness of the Court in
its conduct towards the magistrates. All Wilkes,
his Lord Mayor, or the remnant of the Bill of Rights
attempted, and that without success, was a test in
all boroughs where candidates should be sworn, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
try to obtain shorter Parliaments, the removal of
pensioners and placemen from the House of Commons,
and a more equal representation.</p>

<p>Things being quiet, Lord Bute stole again into
England; from a mixture of timidity and pride he
had been wandering about Italy incognito, under
his private name of Sir John Stuart.</p>

<p>At the beginning of June died three men in great
offices. The first was Lord Strange, Chancellor of
the Duchy of Lancaster; a man of whom much has
been said in these Memoirs.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> He died suddenly at
Bath, aged fifty-five. The second was George Montagu,
Earl of Halifax, Lord Privy Seal. He was of
the same age, but had outlived the reputation of
parts, which in his youth he had been supposed to
have, his fortune, and his constitution, the latter of
which he had destroyed by drinking, and his fortune
by waste and deliberate neglect. The third was
Richard Trevor, Bishop of Durham, a dull proud
man, neither respected nor censured.</p>

<p>The young Earl of Suffolk succeeded Lord Halifax
as Secretary of State,—a post he had declined a
few months before on the want of languages, which
he certainly had not acquired in so short an interval.
The late Prime Minister, the Duke of Grafton,<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> succeeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
Suffolk in the Privy Seal; but, with proud
humility, desired not to be called to the Cabinet,
where he would only have been subordinate. Lord
Hyde was made Chancellor of the Duchy; Dr. Egerton,
Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, was removed
to Durham, and was succeeded by Dr. North,<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> brother
of the Minister.</p>

<p>On the 21st of April, the young Prince of Wales,
and his brother, the Bishop of Osnabrugh, were allowed,
under the conduct of their new governor, the
Earl of Holderness, to go to Gravesend, and see the
men-of-war and Indiamen lying there. There was
nothing remarkable in this; but it was so that the
King himself, the Sovereign of an island and of a
maritime power, had never seen the sea, nor ever
been thirty miles from London at the age of thirty-four;
so great was his indolence, and the restraint
in which his mother had kept him!</p>

<p>On the 24th, the poll began for sheriffs of Middlesex.
Wilkes from the first had by far the greatest
show of hands for him, and Alderman Oliver the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
fewest,—the consequence of his connection with Shelburne’s
faction, whose opposition to Wilkes recoiled
on themselves, and who were hissed and ill-treated
by the mob. The Livery assembled on that occasion
determined to make another remonstrance to
the King, and the Lord Mayor offered to present it,
which was accepted. One Bull, a devotee of Wilkes,
joined him; but Kirkman, a ministerial alderman,
gained ground on them, till the indiscretion of
the courtiers, who laboured indefatigably to defeat
Wilkes, overthrew their own purpose. An imprudent
letter from Lord North’s secretary to a voter
being made public, it enraged the Livery, and
Wilkes and Bull were chosen. Little less offence
was taken at a party novel,<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> written by the profligate
hireling Smollett, to vindicate the Scots and
cry down juries.</p>

<p>The remonstrance being ready, the Lord Chamberlain
wrote to the Lord Mayor, that his Majesty
would not receive more persons with the remonstrance
than were allowed by law. This was resented,
but complied with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
The Chevalier D’Eon, of whom I have given an
account, occasioned at this period much and strange
discourse. A notion had for some time prevailed
that he was a woman in man’s habit. The Duc de
Choiseul believed it from the report of a female
English spy who pretended to be certain of it from
having washed his linen; and as the report spread,
it gained farther credit from assertions that he never
dressed himself before any witness, nor could any of
his comrades recollect an instance of his amours.
His beard, though black, was inconsiderable; and
though he was strong and an excellent fencer, his
legs had a feminine turn. At first he pretended to
resent the report, but afterwards spoke and wrote so
dubiously on his sex, that the most judicious suspected
him for author of the fable from interested
views. Sometimes he disappeared and returned
again, till by the usual discrepancy of opinions, very
great sums were wagered on the question; and he,
though he denied the charge in print, was taxed
with encouraging those bets in order to share the
spoil, according as he should pronounce on his own
gender: but the question came to no issue, and was
forgotten like other legends of the day.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a></p>

<p>In August this year I again went to Paris, and
was witness to the final overthrow of their constitution.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
Since the removal of the Duc de Choiseul,
no Prime Minister had been named. Over the
King’s mind Madame du Barry had almost unlimited
ascendant, except that she could not prevail on him
to place his confidence on the Duc d’Aiguillon, who
certainly intrigued with her husband’s sister, a very
sensible woman, and was suspected of having secured
the mistress herself to his interest by the same
<em>attention</em>. Yet, whether it was owing to the King’s
aversion to strangers, or that Choiseul had instilled
lasting prejudices into his mind against D’Aiguillon,
the latter could not entirely surmount them. He
was a dark, violent, and vindictive man, with less
parts than passions; but the rancour borne to him
and the mortifications it had brought on him, had
taught him to curb his temper; and he now affected
universal benignity and condescension; proceeding
even to obtain the arrears of the pension due to La
Chalotais, the patriot magistrate of Bretagne, whom
he had so cruelly oppressed. Yet would not this
ostentatious benevolence have expunged the odium
his persecutions had created, if another man had not
presented himself as a still more offensive object to
the indignation of the public. This was the Chancellor
Maupeou, a man who had mounted by the
regular steps of villany from flattery through treachery
to tyranny. He had affected such loathsome
idolatry of Choiseul that he had been heard to declare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
he would on no consideration change his house,
because, from the upper windows, he could survey at
least the chimneys of the Hôtel de Choiseul. Yet
while there was but a very dubious prospect of that
Minister’s disgrace, Maupeou, then only Vice-Chancellor,
had betrayed such symptoms of his ambition
and hostile designs that the friends of the Duc de
Choiseul earnestly exhorted him not to raise a secret
enemy higher. Choiseul, with his usual rashness of
confidence in himself, replied, “I know Maupeou is
a rogue, but there is nobody so fit to be Chancellor;”
and Chancellor he made him. Maupeou, who
thought himself fitter to be Minister, did not pique
himself on gratitude, and was a capital instrument
in the Duke’s disgrace. I never saw character
written in more legible features than in those of
Maupeou. He was sallow and black, with eyes
equally penetrating, acute, and suspicious. His
complexion spoke determinate villany; his eyes
seemed either roving in quest of prey for it, or
glaring on snares that he apprehended. His parts
were great and his courage adventurous. Power
was his object, despotism his road, the clergy his
instruments: but the hardness and cruelty of his
nature showed that severity was as agreeable to his
temper as to his views.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> Not being qualified like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
D’Aiguillon to shine in a voluptuous Court where a
woman governed, and probably having noticed the
tendency of the King’s gloomy mind to superstition,
he reckoned, not injudiciously, on the triumph that
bigotry would gain over love in a veteran Monarch;
and accordingly insinuated himself into the confidence
of the King’s Carmelite daughter, Madame
Louise, the almost only engine that the Church of
Rome had employed in the spirit of its ancient
maxims during its late disgraces. At that Princess’s
cell, the Chancellor obtained weekly audiences of
his master: and though, during the suspense of
power, Maupeou and D’Aiguillon acted in a kind of
concert, it became notorious that the first founded
his hopes on the King’s devotion and the other on
his vices. More instances than one broke out of
this contrast of piety and irreligion, not only in the
King but in his own family. His daughters had all
been bred by the Queen to habitual strictness. They
were very weak women; but Madame Adelaide, the
eldest, was something more—she was gallant.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> One
or two of her ladies had been punished many years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
before for furnishing her with indecent novels; and
the King, whose palace was a brothel, in the very
sight of his wife and daughters, had expressed great
offence at that scandal. Madame Adelaide, though
not corrected, yet become more wary, was suspected
of covering her private history with the cloak of
religion, or rather with that of the Bishop of Senlis,
an ambitious prelate: and it was probably by his
suggestions that she drew her sister, Madame
Victoire, into a step very contradictory to their professions,
for all the King’s daughters engaged warmly
in hostilities against the new mistress. Soon after
the Duc de Choiseul’s fall, Madame Victoire sent,
on a feigned pretence, for the Bishop of Orleans,
who had the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">feuille de bénéfices</i>. The Bishop, though
possessed of the recommendation of proper churchmen,
was a jolly, luxurious, dissolute priest, who kept
an opera-dancer<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> publicly at a great expense, and
lodged her in a convent. He had been a favourite
of Choiseul, and remained attached to him. After
the Princess had discoursed with the Bishop on her
pretended business, she asked him negligently his
opinion of the late revolution. He replied, it did
not become him to meddle with affairs of state;
but the Princess insisting, and he knowing her an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
enemy to Madame du Barry, ventured to open his
heart to her. The consequences were, her betraying
the conversation to her father, and the exile of the
Bishop to an abbey: nor could the prayers of his
aged mother, who begged to see him before her
death, obtain a permission for him to visit her at the
capital of his diocese,—a rigour of which the Chancellor
gave many more and some similar instances
in cases of banished presidents and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">avocats</i> of the
Parliaments.</p>

<p>There was another man who, though not pretending
to the first place, bore, during the King’s indecision,
a large share of the public aversion both
from the necessity of his office and the rigour
and partialities with which he executed it. This
was the Abbé du Terray, the new Comptroller-General,
recommended by the Chancellor. It was
a considerable addition to the Comptroller’s unpopularity
that he was wholly governed by a corrupt
and rapacious mistress,<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a>—a woman so notorious for
the sale of offices, that her protector was at last
forced to dismiss her; while the old Duc de la
Vrillière was suffered to indulge his concubine<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> in
the same infamous venality.</p>

<p>Madame du Barry, as I have said, was the fountain
or channel of all these disorders. The doting
Monarch was enchanted with her indelicacy, vulgarism,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
and indecencies, the novelty of which seemed
to him simplicity. Her mirth was childish romping;
her sallies, buffoonish insults; her conversation,
solecisms and ignorance. She pulled off the Chancellor’s
wig, spat in the Duc de Laval’s face at her
levee—he deserved it, for he let her repeat it; and
the King, who deserved it still more, she called
“fool!” and bade hold his tongue. Those who offended
her, she threatened with her power; those who
bowed to her, she treated little better. To none
she was generous, for herself she was rapacious.
She had two governesses of very different characters
and understandings, but the congenial idiot had
most weight with her. This was the Comtesse de
Valentinois, wife of, but parted from, the brother
of the Prince of Monaco, and herself sole heiress
of the Duc de St. Simon. She was a handsome
woman, finely made, but mischievous, impertinent,
and too notorious for her promiscuous amours
even to pass for gallant. The Maréchale Duchesse
de Mirepoix had preceded Madame de Valentinois
in the direction of the mistress. No head was
better, no temper colder than the Maréchale’s. Of
great pride, but capable of any meanness to supply
her profusions at play, she had joined the mistress
to supplant the Minister; but whether Madame du
Barry’s want of generosity chilled the Maréchale’s
importunities for money, or whether her alliance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
with the House of Lorrain<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> made her incapable of
digesting the low familiarities of the mistress, or
whether a prospect of ingratiating herself with the
young Dauphiness, governed by Madame Adelaide,
and consequently an enemy to the mistress, swayed
the Maréchale to swerve from her plan, it is certain
she conceived and expressed both aversion and contempt
for Madame du Barry, and even declined
attending her to an audience of the Dauphiness,
to which Madame de Valentinois, more compliant,
introduced her. While I was now at Paris, having
been long intimate with Madame de Mirepoix and
her family, at Florence, in England, and at Paris,
she told me many anecdotes of that silly and imperious
favourite, most of which I heard attested
by the general voice, or at least corroborated by
similar incidents. One I will mention. At supper
with the King she drank out of the punch-ladle,
and returned it into the bowl. The King said,
“<span class="lote" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Fy donc! vous donnez votre crachat à boire à tout
le monde</span>;” she replied “<span class="lote" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Eh bien! je veux que
tout le monde boive mon crachat.</span>” The same night
my friend Madame du Deffand asking the Maréchale
what would become of Madame du Barry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
should the King die? she replied bitterly, “<span class="lote" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Elle
iroit à la Salpêtrière, et elle est très faite pour
y aller.</span>” As Madame de Mirepoix was not in the
odour of sincerity, I much suspected her of being
concerned in an event of that time, which, however,
she affected to assign as the cause of her resentment
to the mistress,—I mean the disgrace of
her brother, the Prince of Beauvau, which happened
during this journey of mine to Paris; and of
which I was in a situation of knowing many secret
particulars, Madame du Deffand being the confidant
both of the brother and sister, as she had
been before their rupture, continuing loyal to both
sides, and by both esteemed as a woman void of
intrigue. As they supped alternately at her house
several times in a week, and as her friendship for
me induced her to insist on my being admitted to
their most private conferences, I was privy to the
effusions of both parties: and, indeed, they had
so little reserve before me, that one evening the
Prince and Princess of Beauvau were so explicit
on their situation and enemies, that I felt uneasy,
and thinking myself an improper auditor of such
secrets, I begged permission to retire, but the
Princess reproved me sensibly, saying, “Your thinking
these things improper for you to hear, is telling
us that they are improper for us to speak.” I have
already given the character of that Princess, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
mentioned how deeply she had been concerned in
the disgrace of the Duc de Choiseul, in whose fall
she involved herself and her husband, who was a
man of honour, very confined in his understanding,
and acquired accomplishments, which were restrained
to a pedantic purity in his own language, and
who was a mixture of bashfulness and frankness,
with signal courage and unbounded pride. To introduce
his story, I must revert to the situation
of his friend, the late Minister.</p>

<p>The Duc de Choiseul had been ordered to restrain
himself to his wife’s estate in Touraine,
where he had built a magnificent castle. There,
though overwhelmed with debts, he lived with
an increase of profusion, retaining or affecting his
constitutional spirits and levity. It was a new
scene in France, a disgraced Minister still the
object of veneration and love. It was as new
to see the King unpopular, or, which in that country
is synonymous, unfashionable. While Louis
could scarcely assemble a Court round him and
his mistress at Versailles, at Compiègne, the Princes
of the Blood, at their several country seats, and
the Duc de Choiseul at Chanteloup, were followed
by throngs of company. The insult to the King
was doubled by the disrespect paid to his intimations;
for, as nobody was allowed to resort to
Chanteloup without previously applying for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
Majesty’s permission, to which demand this oracular
response was generally given, “<span class="lote" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Je ne le
defends ni le permets</span>,” and as that oracle was
interpreted, or pretended to be interpreted, into
consent, the want of respect for his inclination
could but be deemed contempt by a Prince so
accustomed to have his very looks obeyed. The
mode of visiting the Duke spread, and, for a mode,
lasted long, nor was confined to his former friends;
several persons of both sexes, many ladies whom
he had loved, and others who had never loved
him, affronted the King rather than be unfashionable,
and the Duke, with too much vanity and
too much indifference for his friends, encouraged
the concourse; but, as may well be supposed, this
triumph did but advance his and their destruction,
of which the Prince of Beauvau was the
first example.</p>

<p>The resolution had been taken, by the Chancellor’s
advice, of annihilating or new modelling
all the Parliaments in France, which was now
executed with rigour, or at great expense, wherever
the Court could, by bribes and pensions,
persuade the members to enlist in the new system.
Bourdeaux, for a day or two, resisted, to the great
terror of Maréchal Richelieu, their governor, who
retreated precipitately and sent for troops. In
Languedoc the Prince of Beauvau commanded.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
The King wrote to him with his own hand, telling
him that, having an intention of dissolving the
Parliament of Toulouse, and knowing the Prince’s
sentiments to be contrary to that plan, he could
not employ him any longer in that province. The
rest of the letter was still more kind, but artful,
demanding his frequent attendance on his person,
as one of the four captains of the guard in whom
he could most securely rely, and adding, that his
Majesty had seen the time when it was not possible
to get one of them to attend him. This
sentence alluded to their absence at Chanteloup.
I called even the first part of the epistle tender,
for the dismission of the Prince from his government
was a gentle method of preventing his disobedience
by refusing to break the Parliament,—a
resistance that must have drawn on his imprisonment.
The Prince’s answer was very respectful,
but firm. He gave copies of both letters to Madame
du Deffand, permitting her to communicate
them to me; and he added a comment on that
of the King, which fully interpreted its meaning.
He said the King was so afraid of assassination,
that he dreaded not having his attendance on his
person. “He knows,” said the Prince, “my zeal
and assiduity so well, that, in the year 17—, when
the Imperialists passed the Rhine, and I begged
him to allow me to set out immediately for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
the army, he was three days before he would
give me an answer, and it was but by repeated
importunities that I could wring from him the
permission.”</p>

<p>The moment the Prince’s disgrace was known,
the Duc d’Orleans repaired to him, sat all day
with him and the Princess, and carried them, in
the evening, into his own box at the opera. The
next day that haughty woman sat at home, receiving
the homage of half France. I went in
the crowd. All day were files of coaches passing
the whole length of the Rue St. Honoré, at the
end of which she lived, and no fallen Minister
in England, just commencing patriot, could behave
with more insolence and affected satisfaction; but,
though nothing could bow her spirit, her husband
was reduced to take a humiliating step, and that
without success. His paternal fortune had been little
or none; all he had was from the King’s bounty.
His debts were very great—his income, by the
loss of his government, reduced to a trifle. He
wrote to the King, representing his situation and
begging assistance: it was coldly refused.</p>

<p>Against the Parliaments the sentence went forth.
Next followed the punishment of individuals:—40,000<i>l.</i>
a-year, the King’s pension to the Duc
d’Orleans, were withdrawn; and soon afterwards
the command of the Swiss Guards was taken from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
Choiseul: it brought him in 5000<i>l.</i> a-year, and was
for life; but the King demanded his resignation,
and perpetual imprisonment would have attended
the refusal. Yet that dauntless man dared to stipulate
for terms with his master. He insisted on a
promise of not being made a prisoner, and demanded
an indemnification of what he had paid for
the regiment, 300,000 livres. He was comforted
with hopes of preserving his liberty; 200,000 livres
were granted, and a pension of 50,000 livres a-year
for the joint lives of him and the Duchess, to which
10,000 more were soon added,—a fall extremely
mitigated by these indulgences, and gentle if compared
with the insolence of his conduct.</p>

<p>To the city of Paris, and to the ruined counsellors
of the Parliaments, the Duke remained still dear.
They coupled his cause with their own, from the
unity of the time. The Chancellor adopted the
same idea to incense the King against both. The
depopulation of Paris ensued. So many families
were undone by the new edicts and stoppages of
payments, and so many persons attached to the late
Parliament had quitted the capital, that in less than
twelve months one hundred thousand persons were
computed to have retired into the provinces, and
such as could escape into other countries. The
King’s servants were unpaid; trade at a stand;
distress and dissatisfaction in every countenance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
Daggers threatened the King and Chancellor: the
Comptroller-General threatened to plunder everybody
else to prevent a national bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Still could not the King’s favour draw observance
towards his mistress. Not above six women of
rank would accept her protection or acquaintance.
Almost all the Foreign Ministers shunned her, nor
bad attended her levee—but this cloud was easily
removed: Madame de Valentinois invited them to
supper, where they found Madame du Barry. As
they were not shy to her, she in her turn gave them
a like invitation;<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> they hurried to it and to her
levee, the Nuncio at their head. The Spanish
Ambassador<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> alone was absent, and it passed for an
accident, as he was not at Compiègne; but on his
arrival there with the new Neapolitan Minister,<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a>
the Chancellor made a supper for the same company,
and invited the two strangers. The Spaniard
sent back the card, saying, he had not the honour of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
visiting the Chancellor;<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> the latter with great presence
of mind said, “It is very true, and I ordered
my servant to take care not to go to the Spanish
Ambassador.” But this <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">finesse</i> palliated nothing, for
neither the Spaniard nor Neapolitan would visit
the mistress. I will conclude this long episode
with a ridiculous fact. Mademoiselle L’Ange, the
mistress, had been married to the Comte du Barry,
because, by a most absurd ceremonial, it was necessary
that the King’s mistress should be a married
woman.</p>

<p class="center b2">1771.</p>

<p>On the 12th of September died, after a very short
indisposition, Mr. Robert Wood, a man whose character
was much brighter in the literary than in the
political world.</p>

<p>In October came on the election of the Lord
Mayor. Sawbridge and Townshend, the late Sheriffs,
declared themselves candidates. The Court were
afraid publicly to interfere; but they excited the
wealthier merchants, who groaned under the ascendant
of the upstart tribunes, to make a stand
against the popular faction. The idea was eagerly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
embraced, and one Nash, a senior Alderman, and
very opulent grocer,<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> was set up against the two
demagogues. Townshend’s friends tried to persuade
him to waive his pretensions in favour of Sawbridge,
that the popular interest might not be divided;
but acquiescence and prudence were not the
tone of that Opposition. Nash was grievously insulted
and almost killed in his passage to the election;
but, in the Hall, Wilkes himself was more
the object of attacks, both Sawbridge and Townshend
reviling him, and the latter hinting at his insertion
of abusive paragraphs in the newspapers.
Wilkes challenged them both to prove their accusations.
Townshend equivocated; Sawbridge denied
his having alluded to Wilkes. These squabbles, and
the outrageous behaviour of Captain Allen, who
vomited out invectives against the House of Commons<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a>
on his own case, raised such heats and dissensions,
that Nash was elected Mayor, and Townshend
driven out of the court with hisses. Between
him and Wilkes a war of words and libels and
giving the lie ensued; Wilkes, with impudent humour,
abused Townshend for having reflected illiberally
on the Princess of Wales in the House<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
of Commons. On entering on his shrievalty, Wilkes
canvassed for popularity by ordering the irons of
criminals to be knocked off during their trials, and
by allowing all persons to enter the court without
paying for admittance; but this reformation created
so much crowding and disturbance, that the magistrates
were forced to interpose. To balance these
attempts, Townshend refused, as he had often promised,
to pay the land-tax for Middlesex, on the
pretended plea that the county was not legally represented;
but his goods being distrained, nobody
chose to be a confessor in the same cause.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the month the Pretender suddenly
disappeared, in the most secret manner, and
with scarce any attendance. As France had lately
sent the Marquis de Viomenil, an able general, with
sixty officers, to Poland, it was supposed that she
favoured that adventurer in his pursuit of a crown
that tottered on the head of the wearer, and to
which Stuart, by his mother Sobieski, was allied.
The first news learned of him was, that he was at
Paris, protected by the Duc d’Aiguillon, who had
always wished well to his cause. This was, however,
soon denied; and it was pretended that the
Marquis de Fitzjames, grandson of the Duke of
Berwick, had received orders from Versailles to re-conduct
the Prince, his cousin, to Genoa. In the
streets of that city chance gave him and the Duke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
of Gloucester to meet. They bowed, turned back,
and both smiled. During the Pretender’s eclipse,
the Cardinal of York being questioned on the motive
of his brother’s journey, replied enigmatically,
“He is gone whither he should have gone a year
ago;” a sentence not understood till six months
after, when it came out that Stuart had gone to
Paris to see the Princess of Stolberg, whom he
married there by proxy in the March following,—no
contradiction of the idea that D’Aiguillon favoured
the House of Stuart. He had long countenanced
the Jesuits, though the emergence of party now
obliged him, in opposition to the Chancellor, to
take the contrary part.</p>

<p>In Ireland the scene was very turbulent. Lord
Townshend’s conduct was equally insolent and preposterous.
He set the whole nation at defiance; shut
himself up with a low woman and her friends, and
at his own table publicly ridiculed all parties, declaring
he knew he could, and declaring he would
buy a majority. Nor was this silly profligacy confined
within the palace. He wrote satiric ballads
on friends and foes, and distributed them without
reserve. To the shame of the Irish Parliament,
and to the dishonour of the English Government,
that still supported such a buffoon, a list of pensions
to the amount of 25,000<i>l.</i> a-year was sent by him
to London, and though delayed, was not rejected.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
Still as the English Administration demurred on the
demand, they who had promised their votes for promises,
not seeing the conditions performed, threw
their weight into the opposite scale, lest the Viceroy,
profiting of their acquiescence, should afterwards
frustrate their hopes. These fluctuations, and the
acrimony of the rest of the Opposition, who were
men of parts superior to those employed by the
Lord-Lieutenant, cost the Castle a question early
in the session; nor were its advocates prepared to
support even the address on the speech; for the
capricious ruler had neither sent a copy of the
speech to England, nor communicated it to many
in office. It was consequently composed with his
Lordship’s usual want of judgment, and gave much
offence by charging the deficiencies of the revenue
on the improvements of the country, whereas they
flowed notoriously from the late long prorogation of
Parliament. This defeat alarmed the Court of England,
but instead of recalling the culpable Viceroy,
they granted him his full catalogue of pensions,
excepting only 2000<i>l.</i> a-year to his secretary, Sir
George Maccartney, who being son-in-law of Lord
Bute, it was not thought advisable to furnish so
unpopular a topic to either country.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> The confirmation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
of their pensions soon recalled the stragglers,
and procured a considerable majority to
the Castle; but the debates were so long, and were
followed by such zealous libations, that Dr. Lucas,
the Wilkes of Ireland, fell a victim to his patriotic
fatigues. Still the wanton intemperance of Lord
Townshend’s tongue and conduct, and a further
stretch of authority in erecting new wards of revenue
for the sake of multiplying offices, once more
turned the scale, and by the end of November he
lost a question against a majority of 46, who voted
that it appeared to the House by evidence that the
former boards of Custom and Excise had been sufficient,
and that there was no want of more commissioners.
Many of the placed voted against
the Castle. The late pension to Dyson had given
much additional disgust, being a formal breach of
the King’s promise given by the Duke of Northumberland
that no more pensions for terms of
years should be granted but on extraordinary occasions:
and the Irish Attorney-General being asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
what such occasions were, had replied, On such cases
as Sir Edward Hawke’s and Prince Ferdinand’s.
Was Dyson’s pension a violation of that engagement,
or was such a prostitute tool of office a proper
pendent to the victor of the Spanish navy, or
to the hero of Minden? Those ill-humours, it was
feared, would induce the House of Commons not
to send over the money bills; yet so great was the
attachment of the Irish Whigs to the English
Government, that they did transmit the bills hither,
content with resolving, by a majority of one vote
only, that they would make no provision for Dyson’s
pension. A fresh indiscretion, negligence, or trick,
turned the scale once more against the Castle.
Two copies of all bills, for fear of miscarriage, are
always sent by different roads to Dublin. In one
copy of the returned bills which happened to arrive
first, the English Attorney-General, to whom they
were referred, had omitted the word “cottons.”
The Irish Commons, who deny the Crown’s right of
altering a money bill, flamed at the omission, and
though the exact copy arrived four days after the
former, and was offered to the House by the Lord-Lieutenant,
the tenacious Commons adhered to
their rejection. The English Government immediately
abandoned the alteration, but, to preserve the
King’s pretensions to a power of altering a money
bill, they changed the monosyllable <em>and</em> for <em>or</em>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
which was accepted in Ireland, and returned time
enough to save the expiration of the annual duties;
yet the time pressed so much, that orders were
sent to the Custom-house officers at Dublin, to
plead the recess for the Christmas holidays, as an
excuse for not clearing several ships then in port,
who, as the annual bill was on the point of expiring,
would not have paid the duties. It was marvellous
in the eyes of most men that after such
repeated mismanagement Lord Townshend should
be suffered to retain his government. Many imputed
it to his favour with Lord Bute; yet his
daily insults to Sir George Maccartney, the Earl’s
son-in-law, gave him little title to that patronage.
I believe two other causes contributed to Lord
Townshend’s impunity: one, the difficulty of finding
a successor, every man of character or prudence
dreading the abuse or the expense attendant on
that post; the other was the King’s satisfaction
in being able to govern one of his kingdoms, at
least, by so worthless a Minister—for to be able to
do wrong to a whole nation is the flowering time
of prerogative. The Earl of Shannon was soon
after gained over by hereditary corruption, and
Lord Townshend remained triumphant.</p>

<p>I shall briefly recapitulate a few incidents that
fell out in the remainder of the year, and then
close these long Memoirs with two events, of which,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
one was a royal marriage of the most extraordinary
complexion, the other a royal death, which put
an end to an influence that had given colour to
all the troubles of the present reign.</p>

<p>Lord Rockingham and his friends, wearied out
by continual defeats, the consequences, in a good
measure, of their own weak conduct, determined
to sit still and give over parliamentary opposition,
unless any new invasions of the constitution by the
Crown should awaken the people to resistance, or
foreign troubles should give an opportunity of
attacking the Court by its becoming unpopular;
for one of the evils of bad government is, that
even the best men are apt to regard foreign disgraces
as small misfortunes, when they serve to
check the insolence of domestic tyranny. Yet
might war be an additional evil; success would
advance the power of the Crown, and such unrelaxed
attention to recruiting the army with
Scotchmen had been kept up, that the King had
reason to depend on blind obedience from a great
proportion of it. The marines were almost all
Scots. The haughty English were too much at
their ease to enlist in that despised service. The
Scots, with not less pride, were never stubborn
to their interest. A new occasion gave handle
to reviving abuse on that nation and on their
countryman Lord Mansfield. One Eyre, a wealthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
citizen, had been detected in stealing writing-paper
from public offices, was tried and convicted of that
mean pilfering. He had married a Scottish woman,
and three of her kinsmen solicited the Chief Justice
to allow him to be bailed, which was granted.
This partiality occasioning clamour, the three Scots
avowed and defended in the public papers what
they had done, which but increased the scandal
and redoubled the abuse on their nation. It was
a greater triumph to the discontented, that the
cause between Sir James Lowther and the Duke of
Portland for Inglewood Forest being at last heard,
the former was non-suited, his counsel, Sir Fletcher
Norton, now Speaker, having forgotten, in drawing
the grant, to insert a reserve of the third part of the
rent to the Crown. But these were trifling consolations.
The Court was predominant at home;
Wilkes was fallen, the City was recovering from the
dominion of the popular tribunes, the Rockingham
party was crest-fallen, and now came news that
Spain had actually restored to us the Falkland Islands,
which it had been doubted she ever would surrender.
Thus was the King at peace both at home
and abroad, after a vexatious and ignominious struggle
for near eleven years. It seemed an additional
promise of tranquillity to him that his mother, who,
by the bad education she had given him, and the
bias which she impressed by her creatures on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
counsels, was now known to be dying; and though
she had lost much of her influence, she retained
enough over his awe of her, to perplex his measures
and throw uncertainty over the duration of his Ministries.
At this very period such a storm of private
calamities burst on his head as few kings ever
experienced at once. Part of them touched his
pride, and accordingly penetrated deep; he had a
happy insensibility that surmounted the rest without
an effort.</p>

<p>The malignant humour in the blood of the
Princess Dowager had fallen on her throat, and
though her fortitude was invincible and her secrecy
and reserve invariable, the disorder could no longer
be concealed. She could swallow but with great
difficulty, and not enough to maintain life long.
At times her sufferings and her struggles to hide
them were so much beyond her strength, that
she frequently fainted, and was thought dead. Yet
would she not allow she was ill, even to her children;
nor would she suffer a single physician or
surgeon to inspect her throat, trusting herself
solely to a German page who had some medical
knowledge: and going out to take the air, long after
it was expected that she would die in her coach.
Her danger was publicly known by the beginning of
November, on the fifth of which month, when her
death was hourly expected, an express arrived from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
Leghorn, that her son the Duke of Gloucester was
at the point of death there, and it was concluded by
that time dead. He had gone to a warmer climate
in search of health, and having passed by sea from
Genoa to Leghorn, had fallen into a diarrhœa,
attended by every bad symptom.</p>

<p>The very next day it became public that the Duke
of Cumberland had, on the first of the month, retired
to Calais with a widow, Mrs. Horton, whom
he had married, and had notified his wedding to the
King. What was the astonishment of mankind,
what the mortification of the King and Princess,
and what the triumph of Wilkes, when it came out
that this new Princess of the Blood, was own sister
of the famous Colonel Lutterell, the tool thrust by
the Court into Wilkes’s seat for Middlesex! Could
punishment be more severe than to be thus scourged
by their own instrument? And how singular the
fate of Wilkes, that new revenge always presented
itself to him when he was sunk to the lowest ebb!</p>

<p>The Duke of Cumberland, after having been exposed
to the derision of mankind by his foolish
letters, by his absurd conduct in his intrigue, and
by his pusillanimity on the detection, had added
perfidy to ridicule, and abandoned his victim to
her shame. He had next engaged openly in an
intrigue with another married woman, a very
handsome wife of a timber-merchant; and it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
uncertain which was most proud of the honour,
the husband or the wife. But they had not long
displayed their triumph in all public places, before
the restless Duke seeking new diversions, was
made a more substantial conquest of at Brighthelmstone
by Mrs. Horton, who had for many months
been dallying with his passion, till she had fixed
him to more serious views than he had intended.</p>

<p>She was daughter of Simon Lutterell, Lord Irnham,
and had married a gentleman of fortune, with
whom she had been in love; and had the misfortune
of losing an only child, an infant daughter, and
her husband within a fortnight of each other, still
covering her grief for the first to conceal the misfortune
from the last. She was rather pretty than
handsome, and had more the air of a woman of
pleasure than of a woman of quality, though she was
well made, was graceful, and unexceptionable in her
conduct and behaviour. But there was something so
bewitching in her languishing eyes, which she could
animate to enchantment if she pleased, and her
coquetry was so active, so varied, and yet so habitual,
that it was difficult not to see through it, and
yet as difficult to resist it. She danced divinely,
and had a great deal of wit, but of the satiric kind;
and, as she had haughtiness before her rise, no wonder
she claimed all the observance due to her rank
after she became Duchess of Cumberland. It had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
been believed that she would marry General Smith,
a very handsome well-built young man; but glory
was her passion, and she sacrificed her lover to it,
as she had never sacrificed her virtue to her lover.
Thus in herself she was unexceptionable—at least,
superior to the frailty of her sex, if not above its
little ambition. From her family, though ancient,
she drew many disadvantages. Her ancestors had
been noted and long odious in Ireland for treachery,
villany, and arrogance. Her father did not retrieve
the honour of his blood, and though very
brave in his person, and tolerably brutal, had every
other failure of his race. Nor was he happier in
his own issue. Not intending to return to his native
country, Ireland, he had given up his house there to
his son, but changing his mind, went thither. His
son shut both his father and mother out of the mansion
house, and was countenanced by his brothers and
sisters,—a scene of vexation that pierced the mother’s
heart, and threw her into religious melancholy. But
to the King the most grievous part of the affliction
was the connection with Colonel Lutterell, and the
satisfaction it must give to the friends of the constitution
to see the invasion of their privileges
punished by the same hand by which they had been
attacked; for it was soon known that Mrs. Horton’s
brothers had been privy to the matrimonial transaction
between the Duke and their sister. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
Duke’s flight to Calais with his bride spoke as little
heroism as he had exerted on former occasions,
and showed how little consultation he had held
on the validity of his marriage; yet it proved indissoluble,
the royal family being expressly excepted
out of the late Lord Hardwicke’s Marriage
Act. That proud legislator had indeed inserted
them; but the late Duke of Cumberland and Lord
Holland, in order to traverse Hardwicke, had represented
to the late King that it was an indignity to
the Princes of the Blood to be levelled with the mass
of his subjects, and the haughty Monarch had ordered
them to be erased out of the bill, saying, “I will
not have my family laid under those restraints.”</p>

<p>The King, Queen, and Princess Dowager were
beyond measure enraged at this degradation of their
house; but the misfortune was regarded with indifference
or ridiculed by almost every one else. Yet
though the King was not pitied, no indulgence was
shown to the Duke; even the Opposition giving him
up as Lutterell’s sister had been the object of his
choice. The zealous—that is, the servile courtiers
were loud in their condemnation. Even the placid
and plausible Lord Barrington pronounced that the
new Princess deserved to lose her head,—a wretched
imitation of Lord Clarendon’s<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> outrageous strain of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
affectation, who pretended to demand the trial and
execution of his own daughter for marrying the
Duke of York. The Duchess of Buckingham,
natural daughter of James the Second, a steady and
active Jacobite, observing Sir Robert Walpole’s partiality
to his natural daughter, Lady Mary, sent for
him, and asked him if he recollected what had not
been thought too great a reward to Lord Clarendon
for restoring the royal family? He pretended not
to understand her. She said, Was not the Duke of
York allowed to marry his daughter? Sir Robert
smiled, but told her he was content with the
honours he had attained. He little thought his
natural granddaughter would obtain a rank he
declined for his natural daughter!</p>

<p>The Duke of Cumberland’s marriage was, indeed,
a heavy blow on Lady Waldegrave, and seemed to
cut off all hopes of the King’s permitting the Duke
of Gloucester to acknowledge her for his wife. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
might even inspire the King with the thought of, or
furnish him with an excuse for, breaking such marriages.
At the best it would be a great drawback
on her dignity. The honour became less valuable
when shared with Lutterell’s sister; and though
hitherto all the world had paid her distinguished
regard, and, from her singular piety, virtue, and
propriety of behaviour, had concurred in believing
her married, her situation became more problematic
when Mrs. Horton assumed the title of Duchess
of Cumberland, and she did not dare to wear that
of Duchess of Gloucester.</p>

<p>It was still more remarkable that every one of
the four eldest royal brothers either had married,
were said to have married, or were on the point of
marrying, subjects. Edward Duke of York had
made love to Lady Mary Coke, whose great birth,
great ambition and pride, and untainted virtue, had
certainly never entertained his addresses in a criminal
light. In truth, for some time his attachment
had seemed serious; and though it had not only
worn away for the two last years of his life, but
that he had made a jest of her pretensions, he had
written her such letters as at least she chose to construe
into promises of marriage, and which, to colour
the immoderate grief she acted for his death, she
carried to Princess Amelie, as proofs that her trust
had been well founded: but, as the Duke was very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
liberal of his overtures, there was a young Irish gentlewoman,
whose intellects not being sound, proclaimed
herself loudly his widow. The Dukes of
Gloucester and Cumberland had, as I have said,
gone much farther; and the King himself, as I have
mentioned, seemed to have designed to make
Lady Sarah Lenox his Queen.</p>

<p>The King sent orders to the Duke of Cumberland
not to appear at Court. While he stayed at Calais,
he gave balls under a feigned name, and with his
Duchess made a tour to some towns in French
Flanders.</p>

<p>Finding at last that no violence would be attempted
against his person, he returned to England
on the 30th of November, and retired with
his Duchess to his lodge in the great park at Windsor,
which the King did not take from him. Even
his gentlemen equerries were permitted to remain
about his person, having been chosen by the King,
and having had no knowledge of the Duke’s wedding.
But the Guards were withdrawn, and the Lord
Chamberlain was ordered to whisper, though not in
form, that whoever went to the Duke or Duchess of
Cumberland must not appear at Court. The same
information was given privately to the Foreign Ministers;
and the effect was so universal, or the contempt
for the Duke and hatred of his new connection
so general, that not a man even of the Opposition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
made him a visit. Sir John Delaval<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> and his
wife, the Duke’s intimates, were the sole persons of
a rank above the vulgar that went near them, except
the Lutterells. Temple Lutterell, one of the
brothers, a very sensible lawyer, was supposed to be
author of many libels published in the papers against
the King’s cruelty to his brother; yet it ought to be
acknowledged, that the King could not well express
less resentment.</p>

<p>In the meantime came more favourable accounts
of the Duke of Gloucester. He recovered, though
the hiccup and symptoms of death had appeared
on him; and as soon as his strength was a little
recruited, he sailed to Naples, the voyage whither
again brought on a return of his flux; but he once
more mastered it; and the English physicians were
of opinion that the discharge might for some time
relieve the virulence of his complaint, though no
man flattered himself with a long duration of the
Duke’s life. On his return he visited Rome, and
the Stuarts had once more the mortification of seeing
a Prince of the rival Blood, and a Protestant,
distinguished with peculiar honours by a Pope, who
even conversed with him.</p>

<p>This was the last gleam of comfort to the dying
Princess: but this reprieve of her son was bitterly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
dashed by the shame and misery that fell on her
daughter, the Queen of Denmark, of which, as she
languished till the beginning of the next year,<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> she
lived long enough to hear, and but just long enough
to die with the anxiety of dreading a fatal conclusion
to that daughter.</p>

<p>She now beheld the wretched consequences of
the wretched education she had given her children.
The Queen of Denmark had been kept in her
nursery till sent to Copenhagen; had had no company
but servants, and could have seen nothing
but an intimacy with Lord Bute, which all the
Princess’s children spoke of with disgust; and
could have heard nothing but passionate lamentations
from the Princess on the impotence of power
possessed by English Sovereigns,—lessons that seem
to have made but too deep impression on the inexperienced
young Queen of Denmark, when she came
to have a lover, and be mistress of absolute power.
The Duke of Gloucester, the Princess of Wales had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
always loved the least, though the most meritorious
of her children. She thought him insuperably
dull,—nor was he bright: one day in his childhood
she ridiculed him before his brothers and sisters,
and bade them laugh at the fool. He sat silent and
thoughtful. She said, “What! now you are sullen.”
He replied, “No, he was thinking.”—“Thinking!”
replied his mother, with scorn; “and pray,
what was you thinking of?” He answered, “I was
thinking what I should feel if I had a son as unhappy
as you make me!”</p>

<p>This unfortunate mother’s fate is a speaking lesson
to princes. Had the credit and happiness of
her children been her object, her own life might,
except in those she lost, have been prosperous and
renowned. Her own ambition, and the desire of
making her son more powerful than the laws allowed,
led her and him into disgraces, mortifications,
humiliations. Reviled, traduced, hated, she scarce
dared to appear out of her palace; her Favourite
she saw driven from his country, and his life frequently
endangered. Her younger children disgraced
her; and the eldest, as well as herself,
missed the despotism she sought for both, and
obtained only that triste pre-eminence of Turkish
sultans, being shut up with mutes in their own
seraglio.</p>

<span class="subhead">CHARACTER AND INFLUENCE OF LORD BUTE.</span></h2>

<p class="p1 b2 center">(<a href="#v1">Vol. i.</a> p. 10.)</p>

<p>Walpole is correct in stating that “Mr. Pitt had been
for some time on the coldest terms with Lord Bute.”</p>

<p>What was the original cause of this coldness does not
appear. Among the Elliot MSS. is a long letter from
Lord Bute to Sir Gilbert Elliot, dated the 30th of April,
1760, expressing deep regret at the interruption of the
“fraternal union” which had previously subsisted between
him and Mr. Pitt, and empowering Sir Gilbert to use the
first favourable opportunity to bring about a reconciliation.</p>

<p>Efforts were accordingly made by Sir Gilbert to satisfy
Mr. Pitt, and they elicited a long statement from the latter
of his grievances, which is not very intelligible, except that
jealousy at the superior favour and influence attained by
Lord Bute at Leicester House was his most prominent
feeling. When Lord Bute and Mr. Pitt met at Kew on
the King’s accession, no intercourse had taken place
between them for some months; on that occasion some
mutual civilities passed and nothing more.</p>

<p>The meeting between Lord Bute and Mr. Pitt, after the
council, (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">supra</i> vol. i. p. 9,) was at the request of Lord
Bute, and not of Mr. Pitt, and it was sought by the former<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
in the hope of his being able to recover Mr. Pitt’s regard.
He made every concession that the nicest honour could
have required, to Mr. Pitt’s private feelings, and expressed
unqualified approbation of his public conduct, even with
respect to the war, and ended by offering him his cordial
and sincere friendship. Mr. Pitt’s answer certainly held
out no prospect of any reconciliation; it is cold and repulsive.
He makes it plain that he would insist on entire
and uncontrolled power in the cabinet; and the language
in which this determination is expressed must have been
most unpleasant to Lord Bute, as conveying an implied
censure of his political views, which he admitted were to
give disinterested assistance, as the King’s friend, in carrying
on the government.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></p>

<p>The position which Lord Bute thus designed for himself
was as visionary as that “Patriot King” described by
Bolingbroke; but Lord Bute was himself a visionary, and
if Mr. Pitt had possessed the tact and temper of Sir
Robert Walpole, he might have gained such an ascendancy
over Lord Bute as to make the latter instrumental in carrying
on his government. But Mr. Pitt too heartily despised
and disliked Lord Bute to condescend to manage
him, and there were others without the same fastidiousness,
who soon turned the vain ambition of that nobleman
to their own account. It was his constant interference, as
well in public measures as in the disposal of patronage,
that led to his appointment to the Secretaryship. Some
of the Ministers thought, and wisely too, that his being
a member of the Government would make him less dangerous.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a>
Their own intrigues, however, led to his further
elevation, the natural and inevitable result of which was,
his utter failure and precipitate fall.</p>

<p>Walpole, in more mature age, expressed a more favourable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
opinion of Lord Bute than will be collected from this
work. He <span class="locked">says:—</span></p>

<p>“Lord Bute was my schoolfellow. He was a man of
taste and science, and I do believe his intentions were
good. He wished to blend and unite all parties. The
Tories were willing to come in for a <em>share</em> of power,
after having been so long excluded,—but the Whigs were
not willing to grant that share. Power is an intoxicating
draught; the more a man has, the more he desires.”<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></p>

<p>The most able character of Lord Bute, and a masterly
one it is, has been drawn by Lord Chesterfield.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> No one
can read it without admiring the knowledge of the world,
sagacity, and fine discrimination of its author.</p>

<p>“Duchess told me,” says Lord Malmesbury,<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> “that in
1762, when Lord Bute came in, it was in consequence of
the Duke of Devonshire and Lord Rockingham going to
the King, and saying that if his Majesty meant to be directed
by Lord Bute’s counsels and advice, he had better
bring him forward at once. This he (the King) did, and
that when Lord Bute went out early in 1763, it was because
he thought, by offering his resignation to the King,
that his Majesty would press him to remain in and add to
his power and influence; but the contrary arrived: and
the Duchess said her mother and the King used to laugh
together at the Rockinghams and Lord Bute having been
the dupes of their cunning. The first lost their offices,
which they wanted to keep, and the latter the office he was
ambitious of retaining.”—Dec. 4th, 1794.</p>

<p>When the Duchess of Brunswick spoke of events which
had happened thirty years back, strict accuracy of recollection
could not be expected from her, and she is hardly entitled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
to belief in opposition to contemporary authorities.
Lord Bute’s letters—his declarations to his friends—his
known disposition—all combine in furnishing the strongest
evidence that his wish to quit office was perfectly sincere.
Letters are still extant in private repositories, amply sufficient
to prove that for some time at least after his accession,
the King placed unbounded confidence in Lord Bute;
and the power exercised by that nobleman in providing
for his dependants on his retirement, as well as the universal
impression at the time, not only of the public but
of the persons likely to possess the best information of
what was passing at Court, betray no indication of any
change in the King’s feelings. Indeed, whatever might
have been his Majesty’s defects, inconstancy was not one

<p>He was the son of a Colonel in the Guards, who
died poor. In early life, he had to struggle with many
difficulties and disappointments. “By much exertion,”
to use his own words, somewhat abridged, “he became
a popular preacher in the City. He had a turn at
St. Paul’s, when Bishop Hare was present. The Bishop
liked his sermon, sent for him, heard him a second time,
and then gave him a prebendal stall. Having thus got
his foot on the ladder, he mounted rapidly.”<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> He was
a man of sense and learning, and of unexceptionable character.
He gained little influence or weight at Court;
perhaps he had the prudence not to seek it. The King<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
certainly liked him, and paid him frequent visits at Farnham
Palace, after his promotion to Winchester. He died
in 1781.</p>

<p>Sir Gilbert Elliot’s account of the interviews between
the King and his Ministers, just before the removal of
Mr. Grenville, corresponds generally with Walpole’s narrative.
It proves how reluctantly the King gave up Mr.
Mackenzie. His Majesty, indeed, did not yield until he
was driven to an unconditional surrender; and, after
appealing in vain to Mr. Grenville’s sense of honour, in
obliging him to depart from the engagement he had made
to Mr. Mackenzie, he used these expressions, “I will not
throw my kingdoms into confusion; you force me to break
my word, and you must be responsible for the consequences.”</p>

<p>The indignation felt by his Majesty on this occasion,
he took no pains to conceal. The Duke of Bedford’s
remonstrance, strong as it may have been, certainly did
not irritate the King to the extent that Walpole has stated,
or Sir Gilbert Elliot would have commented on it severely,
which he has not done. The only reply made by the King
to the Duke’s demand of additional confidence was, “that
the confidence necessary for the despatch of business, he
had given them; as to favour, they had not taken the way
to merit it.”<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a>—E.</p>

<h3 class="p1">TO THE EDITOR OF “THE LONDON MAGAZINE.”</h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>A Letter in one of our public prints, reflecting upon
his Catholic Majesty, being everywhere mentioned as the
principal cause of an apprehended war with Spain, I have
sent you that celebrated production for the entertainment
of your readers, as it is extremely difficult to meet with a
genuine copy, and as a spurious paper may possibly be
foisted on the world without the interposition of <em>official</em>
authority.</p>

<h3>TO THE GAZETTEER.</h3>

<p>Your correspondent Seneca seems mightily pleased with
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon-mot</i> of G—— the Second. I agree with him, there
is a good deal of humour in it, but a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon-mot</i>, before it can
be fully allowed as such, ought to be founded strictly
in truth. If G—— the Second’s <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon-mot</i> is relative only
to the unwise of the House of B——k that were born
before the commencement of the present century, or that
were born in Germany, it may probably have truth for
its foundation. But I would start even the Duke of C——
against any one of the three crowned heads of the Bourbon
family. There seems to be a distinct climax amongst their
three Bourbonian Majesties. The King of Sicily’s eldest
brother, we all know, was put aside from the throne because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
he was an absolute, irrecoverable idiot; his present
Majesty of Sicily is, I conceive, just one remove from
his brother.</p>

<p>The next crowned head of the Bourbon family, I mean
the King of Spain, may be allowed to be one remove and
a half from his Sicilian Majesty, if weighed in the scale of
intelligent or intellectual beings.</p>

<p>As a proof that the King of Spain is removed somewhat
more than a degree and a half from downright
idiotcy, I will relate a story of him, which will convince
any fautor of monarchical government that his Most Catholic
Majesty is endowed with sufficient understanding
to govern the rich and powerful kingdom of Spain, or,
indeed, any other kingdom in Christendom, according to
the modern standard of Bourbonian kings.</p>

<p>Some few years ago, Charles the Third, his present
Catholic Majesty, who is passionately fond of hunting,
had accoutred himself as usual for the chase. It was in
the month of January, and the weather at the extremest
point of cold. The snow began to fall in such broad
flakes that the poor King was absolutely prohibited the
chase that day. The servants about his person were ordered
to lay three or four dozen of watches before their
royal master, in order that he might amuse himself with
the delightful and instructive pastime of winding them
up. It seems even this King affects and is allowed all
the pageantry, ceremony, and parade of regal state. His
servants, thus having brought him the watches, retired,
and left him all alone. It is remarkable of this crowned
head, that, like Cicero, he is <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">nunquam minus solus quam
cum solus</i>; that is to say, he never perceives the least
difference whatever between a solitude and a multitude.</p>

<p>I take the winding-up of thirty or forty watches to be an
operation which must soon fatigue the mental faculties,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
and those faculties fatigued make room for the exertion
of the bodily powers; accordingly, we are told that his
Majesty, who is an enemy to idleness and inaction, the
moment he had wound up his watches, immediately perceived
by dint of instinct that the weather was extremely
cold. To counter-operate the inclemency of this sharp
season, what could his Majesty do? His servants had left
his hunting-whip in the room with him; this room was
hung with gobelin tapestry. The vivid colours and lively
figure of an Arabian steed, ready saddled, was represented
to the life. His Majesty, who is not easily deceived,
immediately approaches the highly-coloured arras, attempts
to mount his Bucephalus; the pictured stirrup fails to
admit his kingly foot, and, O dire mishap! plump falls the
Majesty of Spain on the resplendent wax-rubbed floor.
Long did this mighty monarch, over whose wide-extended
dominions the sun never ceases to shine, ponderate in his
kingly breast, whether he should severely correct the
resplendent wax-rubbed floor, or whether his hunting-whip
would not fall with greater justice on the still prancing,
proud Arabian steed. Wisely did Charles the Third distinguish
between primary and secondary causes. The saddled
palfrey, therefore, could not but appear to be the
proper and immediate object of royal resentment. This
weighty point determined, and Charles having thus acted
the two parts of juryman and judge, there remained only
the executioner’s part for him to perform. Instantly he
sprung from off the floor, and with his three-thonged hunting-whip,
during thirty-four minutes, two seconds, and a-half,
with hand uplifted, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sublimi flagello</i>, flogged the unmoving,
unmoved stately quadruped. At length, half-drowned
and half-suffocated in his own unfragrant exudations,
which copiously oozed out at every pore, the King,
quite spent, again involuntarily rushed rumbling down upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
the resplendent wax-rubbed floor. Alarmed at this unusual
noise, the guard attendant in the outer room, breaking
through all order and every etiquette of Madrid’s
solemn stately-marching court, quickly rushed in the apartment
royal, and found their monarch, Cyrus-like, weltering,
if not in reeking gore, at least in reeking sweat.</p>

<p>The faculty, called in, all stunned aghast! and they
themselves shivering with cold intense, much wonder
whence the cause of all this burning heat, which thus
unknown had overpowered their King. When straight, as
rising from a trance and starting into life again, thus oracularly
answered Charles the Third:</p>

<p>“Be not surprised that thus I sweat, for by this watch
of Graham’s make, thirty-four minutes, two seconds, and
a-half, have I been flogging with this whip, whose ponderous
handle is of massy gold, that high-stomached quadruped,
whose traitorous hoof hath twice extended my
whole length upon this floor.” Much more spoke he,
while every word was to the full as pertinent and wise.</p>

<p>From these outlines, characteristic of this crowned head,
your readers will perceive I had strong reasons for saying
that Charles the Third, King of the Two Indies, is rather
more than a degree and a-half less unwise than his son,
Ferdinand the Fourth, King of the Two Sicilies.</p>

<p>In my next letter I will draw the picture of that other
crowned head of the Bourbon family, Louis the Fifteenth,
King of Navarre.</p>

<p class="center b2">EXTRACTS FROM THE MS. LIFE OF THE DUKE OF GRAFTON,
BY HIMSELF, ILLUSTRATIVE OF WALPOLE’S MEMOIRS OF
GEORGE THE THIRD, WITH SOME INTRODUCTORY OBSERVATIONS.</p></blockquote>

</div>

<p>Charles second Duke of Grafton, Lord Chamberlain and
Knight of the Garter, grandson to Charles the Second, had
three sons, all of whom died before him. Lord Augustus
Fitzroy, the only one that left issue, was a captain of the
navy; like his grandfather, the first Duke, he was a bold
and active seaman, and having of course great interest, he
seems to have been constantly employed. In one of his
first cruises, happening to be on the American station, he
fell in love with Miss Cosby, the daughter of Colonel
Cosby, the Governor of New York, and married her, without
waiting for his father’s consent, when he was only seventeen
years old. His career was brief, for he died at
Jamaica, in his twenty-fifth year, of a fever contracted at
the unfortunate attack on Carthagena, where he had served
on board the Orford man-of-war.</p>

<p>Lord Augustus left two sons; the younger entered the
army, and having distinguished himself at Minden and
other engagements during the seven years’ war, rose high in
the army and held various posts at Court. He was raised
to the peerage by the title of Baron Southampton. He
died in 1797. The present Lord Southampton is his
grandson.</p>

<p>Augustus Henry, the eldest son, who eventually succeeded
his grandfather as Duke of Grafton, was born in October
1735. After receiving his early education under Mr. Newcome
at Hackney school, a seminary of high repute in that
day, he was removed to Peterhouse, Cambridge, and remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
a sufficient time at the University. He was committed
by his grandfather to the care of a Genoese governor,
and sent on what was called the <em>grand tour</em>. Pursuing the
beaten track, he visited the south of France and Switzerland,
wintered at Naples and at Geneva, and, returning by
Germany and Holland to Paris, passed five months under
the protection of the British Ambassador, Lord Albemarle,
by whom he was introduced to all the gaiety, and, judging
from the character of his patron, most probably the dissipation
of the capital. He came back to England, on attaining
his majority, to be elected member for Thetford, a borough
which the vicinity of Euston placed under the control of
his family, and took his seat in the House of Commons in
the beginning of the session of 1756.</p>

<p>Lord Euston (as he had now become by the death of his
uncle) had far from neglected the cultivation of his mind
during his travels. Besides consulting the various historical
works relating to the countries which he visited, it
appears that he read Mr. Locke’s Treatises with great
attention, and the principles of government there laid down
guided him throughout his long life. If he departed from
them it was from inadvertence, and not from design. Thus
he acquired early a reputation for intelligence and accomplishments,
which caused him on his arrival in England
to be placed with Lord Huntingdon, who passed for the
most promising young nobleman of his day, in the household
then forming for the Prince of Wales, who had just
attained his majority. The Prince wished him to be the
Master of the Horse in preference to Lord Huntingdon, but
the latter having the Duke of Newcastle’s interest, obtained
the nomination, and Lord Euston, with some reluctance,
accepted the inferior post of Lord of the Bedchamber. He
held it only a few months. The service happened to be
unusually constant, owing to the absence of some of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
colleagues and the illness of others, and he found it so
irksome, that, on finding Lord Bute indisposed to afford
him any relief, he resigned. The Prince parted from him
with marked reluctance, which was so little shared by
Lord Bute, that the latter was believed to have made an
unscrupulous use of his influence in order to effect the removal
of a formidable competitor.</p>

<p>On the death of the Duke of Grafton in May, 1757,
which was occasioned by a fall from his horse, Lord Euston
succeeded to his title, as well as to the large possessions
attached to it.</p>

<p>This elevation brought with it, as usual, the smiles and
favours of the Ministry on a young nobleman whose rank
and wealth, and evidently no common parts, seemed to destine
him for an important share in the government of the
country. The Duke, however, at first appeared to shew a
decided preference for a retired life. He was eagerly addicted
to field sports: and took equal pride and pleasure in
his pack of hounds, which made Wakefield the resort of
the keenest hunters of the day. Newmarket, too, had unfortunately
strong attractions for him. Above all, he had a
home which had not yet lost its charms; for in January,
1736, he had married the Hon. Miss Liddel, only child
of Lord Ravensworth, with the fairest prospects of
happiness. The beauty, grace, and talents of the Duchess
have been celebrated by contemporary writers, nor
was she less entitled to praise for higher qualities. She
had a warm heart and was susceptible of strong attachment.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a>
The Duke was fully capable of appreciating her
merits; and there is no reason to suppose that the first
years of their union were clouded by any serious differences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
In 1761, the Duke made a tour with the Duchess and
his two elder children on the Continent; and it was only
on his return in the following year, that he seems to have
entertained serious thoughts of taking a more active part
in politics.</p>

<h3>EXTRACT I.</h3>

<p>But to return to Mr. Grenville’s Ministry, which had
been supported by great majorities (except on the debate
on General Warrants) in both Houses, we can but remark
that the vexatious and impolitic acts that were passed in
the year 1764, and at the beginning of 1765, under these
mighty majorities, were rapidly working out the greatest
distresses and losses to the country.</p>

<p>The Administration met the Parliament in 1765, with
great confidence in their own strength, and too little attention
to those steps by which they had ascended to their
power. The illness of the King during the session
awakened the duty of Parliament to bring forward a Regency
Bill, which was early suggested by the King himself.
The Bill was accordingly brought into the House of Peers,
and there passed, though so drawn as to exclude the
Princess-Mother from being nominated Regent. In the
Commons, this affront was taken off by the insertion of her
Royal Highness’s name, and by the amendment carried up,
and agreed to by the Lords; when the Ministers had the
mortification of being obliged to submit to bear that affront
which they had destined for others.</p>

<p>The evident intention of the King’s principal servants
in this business, sealed their own overthrow; and as they
had never been graciously considered in the closet, the
consequences which would naturally follow were easily
foreseen. Yet some were so blinded with ambition as not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
to be aware of the slippery ground on which the Ministry
stood; and it was observed with surprise that Mr. Charles
Townshend, in particular, a short time after, accepted the
post of Paymaster, on the dismission of Lord Holland,
who had, on the retreat of Lord Bute, given up the lead
of the House of Commons to Mr. George Grenville.</p>

<p>My friends very justly reproached me for idling my
time away in the country, during a great part of this
session; without attending sufficiently to that duty in Parliament
which became my station, and was expected from
me. They, however, treated me with more attention than
such conduct deserved; for I was by them constantly acquainted
with all that was passing in the political world,
and the Opposition had so little expectation of being called
upon to take a part in Administration, unless under and
by the recommendation of Mr. Pitt, that even when the
coolness between the King and his servants was apparent
to all mankind, to act under Mr. Pitt became the general
voice, and was our principal wish.</p>

<p>It may not be amiss to insert Lord Rockingham’s letter,
which brought me up to attend the Regency Bill, as it may
serve to shew the light in which the Marquis and his
friends considered the Bill on its introduction; and, afterwards,
it will be proper to enter into some detail on many
negotiations and occurrences that followed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright smaller">
“April 24th, 1765.
</p>

<p class="in0">“<span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>“His Majesty came to the House to-day, to open the
affair of the Regency Bill. I enclose to your Grace the
speech. Our Address was only in general terms, to congratulate
upon his Majesty’s recovery, and to thank him for
his care and foresight, &amp;c., in providing for the security of
the country, &amp;c., and to promise that we will proceed in
this matter with all expedition. Nothing was said in our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
House by any of our friends. Lord Temple and Lord
Lyttelton went away before the Address was moved. The
Bill, I expect, will be brought in on Friday and read the
first time; and it would not surprise me if a second reading
and commitment should be pressed for that day or for
Saturday.</p>

<p>“Upon so great a point I cannot refrain expressing my
earnest wish that your Grace should not be absent. Your
Grace will observe, by the Speech, that it is not intended
that the Regent shall be appointed by the Act; but left to
the King by instrument to nominate either the Queen or
some <em>one of his Royal Family</em>. It is said, that by this description,
a certain great lady is excluded: how far it is so,
I am not certain. But supposing it was so, yet a fresh objection
lies from the unusualness of the Regent not being
nominally inserted. There are other parts expected in the
Bill which will be liable to great objections, and I doubt
not but that there will be some Lords who can and will
make their objections.</p>

<p>“Lord Temple, yesterday, wished I would have sent an
express to you for to-day; but the time was so short that
your Grace would scarce have arrived in London before
three o’clock this evening; and, indeed, I doubted whether
anything would have been entered upon in the House today.</p>

<p>“I have more expectation on what may pass on Friday;
but even on that I have hesitated for some hours whether to
send to you or no, as I would not willingly occasion you a
long journey to little purpose: the very chance of a debate
deserves your attention, and in that light I will hope to
apologize for my venturing to do what I now do.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l8">“I am ever, &amp;c.</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Rockingham</span>.”

</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
Notwithstanding there had been many reports of dissensions
among his Majesty’s Ministers and servants during
the course of the whole winter, and particularly towards
the conclusion of the session, no authentic accounts ever
reached me of them, nor of the King’s displeasure at their
conduct and behaviour to himself, till I received an express
from the Duke of Cumberland. The letter, written by his
Royal Highness, was brought to me at Wakefield Lodge,
the 14th of May, at night. It contained an intimation of
the King’s intention of <em>changing his Administration</em>, of taking
in their places those whom his Royal Highness said both
<em>he</em> and <em>myself</em> had wished in power, and adding a desire of
talking <em>public as well as private affairs over with me</em>. This
summons was instantly obeyed, and I got to Cumberland
House even before the Duke was called. He sent for me
to come immediately into his bedchamber, and opened the
discourse by telling me that, though he was only commanded
by the King to intimate his present dispositions to employ
Mr. Pitt and the Lords Rockingham and Temple, yet he
was confident that he should be forgiven if he stretched
his commission by adding me to the number, saying at the
same time, with his usual goodness, that he had that regard
and opinion of me that he could not avoid wishing to
hear my thoughts and inclinations, as well for myself as
for my friends, on such an occasion. After expressions
of this sort, the Duke told me that he had had some
knowledge of his Majesty’s intentions before the Regency
Bill was brought into our House; but, as he had endeavoured
to dissuade the King from bringing it in at so
short a notice, and when so little time was left to consider
a matter of that importance, he had humbly begged to
decline giving his Majesty his opinion of men, as he was
sure those whom he might recommend would not undertake
that Bill, so drawn, and pressed at such a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
The behaviour of the Ministers on that occasion, who
wished to exclude the Princess Dowager, was such as
neither answered their own design nor in any way turned
to their honour, but put the finishing-stroke to the dislike
the King had already conceived against them. After
Lord Halifax had moved that the King might in that
Bill be empowered to name as Regent any one of his
Royal Family, descendant of George the Second, they
thought their end was answered; but soon saw the meanness
to which they were obliged to bend by assenting
afterwards to the amendment proposed, and made to it
in the Lower House, of allowing the Princess Dowager, by
name, to be added to those who might be Regent. The
defeat of their design was not the only consequence of
their attempt, which was plainly seen through; and the
Princess was naturally expected to resent this affront.
Their servility in submitting was sufficient to add in the
King’s mind a contempt of their characters to that disgust
he already had for men who had brought an odium
on his Government, and who had not, as he expressed,
served him with decency in the closet.</p>

<p>The King, in this situation, and a few days before the
intended prorogation of Parliament, sent for the Duke of
Cumberland, asked his advice in forming such an Administration
as would please his kingdom, and carry weight and
credit both at home and abroad,—two points of which he
was sensible the country as well as the Crown stood in need.
The Duke, penetrated with this mark of the King’s favour,
and more with the return of His Majesty’s confidence, expressed
his sensibility of both; but added, that he was certain
that the King would not, in any shape, mean that he
should engage in an affair of such delicacy and real consequence
in any manner derogatory to his honour. “Give me
leave, sir,” said the Duke, “to observe, that I should hurt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
that honour, as well as lose the esteem of the world, if I
was forming an Administration in which Lord Bute should
have either weight or power.” After every assurance given
by the King on this head, the Duke could no longer doubt
of the sincerity of such a proposal. Much conversation
then passed on the means of forming a new Administration,
and the Duke left the King, commanded by him to
think fully upon it. His Majesty had intimated, however,
his <em>wish</em> to have Lord Northumberland at the head of the
Treasury,—a proposal of which, in the hurry of so many
and important matters, I sincerely think the Duke did not
immediately weigh the consequence; but he soon afterwards
saw it, and had the satisfaction also to find that the
King himself abandoned it when it was shewn to him to
be inconsistent that so near a relation of Lord Bute’s
should hold so great a post of business,—for, let his professions
have been ever so satisfactory to those who were
to act with him, the world would still deem the Treasury
in the hands of a lieutenant of Lord Bute’s, and would consider
such a step incompatible with all the former conduct
and professions of those who were to form the new Administration.</p>

<p>This was the Duke’s account of what had passed: he
then sounded my own inclinations, and whether I wished
anything in such a change for myself, or what for my
friends; he told me he both disapproved and much lamented
that I was so much retired from the world, and not
giving, in my rank, every assistance which my country had
a right to require of me. I answered his Royal Highness,
with many thanks for the favourable opinion he had of
me, that I was very sensible that my power of serving my
country he rated infinitely beyond my abilities; but that
no one could in his heart wish it better, nor would go
further to serve it; and that I did not mean to retire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
another year so much from the world as I had done. I
expressed, next, that the small experience I had early in
my life of a Court, had made me take a resolution which
was every day strongly confirmed, that no inducement
could lead me to take a Court employment; but that I was
ready to undertake any one of business, provided I was
satisfied that I could go through such an office with
credit to myself and without prejudice to my country: that
I owned my wish was to have my brother, Colonel Fitzroy
Scudamore, and some other friends, who had been sufferers
on my account, replaced, which would sufficiently
shew my intentions, and to be left myself to applaud and
forwardly to support the measures which I was confident
would be pursued by an <em>honourable Administration</em>. Indeed,
such appeared to me, and does still, the way in
which I could have been of the most use. The lower
posts of business were not fit for the rank I stood in, nor
were the greater more fit for the total inexperience I had
of any office. Whereas, the support of a man who was
looked upon as steady in his conduct, and not famed for
supporting all Administrations, would have given weight
to a cause, if I could have been allowed to have served it
without being in place.</p>

<p>The Duke was not satisfied with my answer, and proposed
and pressed me to be at the head of the Board
of Trade, which I begged to decline, looking upon it
in a very different light from what I found his Royal
Highness did, as I really thought it as difficult a post
as any whatever. As this transaction was not to transpire
at that time, I asked the Duke’s leave to return
into the country again that very day, which I did. I
should have mentioned before, that whilst I was with the
Duke, he asked me this question,—whether I thought
an Administration could be formed (principally out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
minority) without Mr. Pitt? On my assuring him that my
opinion was, that nothing so formed could be stable, he
said, he hoped there was every reason to think he would
engage, as Lord Albemarle had been with him the day
before, and that his Lordship thought he saw it in a
favourable light.</p>

<p>With these hopes I left London, and in a few days
afterwards had the mortification to see them blasted, by
receiving a fresh messenger from the Duke of Cumberland,
desiring my immediate attendance in London. A
letter, written by Lord Albemarle by the Duke’s order,
dated at night, May 22nd, brought me this account in words
to this effect,—that the Duke had been five hours with
Mr. Pitt at Hayes, without prevailing on him to take a
part; that the King was the next morning to answer some
<em>questions</em>, to be put to him by his present Ministers, in one
of which his Royal Highness was personally concerned,
and that the Duke desired my support on the occasion.
Lord Albemarle also adds, that the King had been most
insolently treated by his Ministers, and shamefully abandoned
by those who should have profited by this occasion
to serve their King and country. On receiving this account,
my first step was to go instantly to receive his
Royal Highness’s commands, whom I found just going to
Court to know the King’s determination. He told me,
however, in a few words, the advice he had given to the
King the night before, and referred me to Lord Albemarle
for the whole of what had passed since I last waited upon
him, commanding me also to wait upon him on his return
from St. James’s, and to dine with him. Lord Albemarle’s
account tallied so exactly with what the Duke afterwards
related to me, that it is needless to repeat both. His
Royal Highness said, that finding Lord Temple cooler on
the subject than he expected, and that Mr. Pitt was also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
less forward since Lord Temple’s arrival in London, he
had explained to the King the absolute necessity there
was of every object being removed that might prevent
Mr. Pitt’s taking a part, and hoping even to have his
Majesty’s assurance that many measures might be redressed,
and some wholly broken through, to make it more
satisfactory to Mr. Pitt on entering upon his Ministry.</p>

<p>On the preceding Saturday, the King had sent for his
Royal Highness, and had told him, in the kindest terms
and most explicit words, that he put himself wholly, in
this affair, into his hands; that he saw plainly the propriety
of his advice. For which reason he ordered him to go the
next morning to Mr. Pitt, with full powers from him to
treat with Mr. Pitt, and to come into the constitutional
steps he had before mentioned as essential to the country;
as also, that his Majesty was not backward to lean to his
foreign politics, if he (Mr. Pitt) should think it most beneficial,
when he saw how affairs then stood. His Royal
Highness told me that he had patience to attend to very
long discourses, which Mr. Pitt held on the subject, in
which the Duke declared he could not always follow him:
as he was sometimes speaking of himself as already the
acting Minister, and then would turn about by showing
how impossible it was for him ever to be in an employment
of such a nature, and always would end by observing
that if such and such measures were pursued, he would
<em>applaud</em> them loudly from whatever men they came. Mr.
Pitt also told his Royal Highness, that if an Administration
went in on such ground as he had laid down, he
would <em>exhort</em> his friends—nay, his brothers, to accept; but
that he doubted much whether the latter (meaning Lord
Temple and J. Grenville) would.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt’s plan abroad was, for a close union with the
northern Courts of Germany, together with Russia, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
balance the Bourbon alliance, to which the Duke gave
the answer I before mentioned, and that the King was
ready to support Mr. Pitt in any alliance that he should
judge the most valid to check any attempts that might
arise from the family compact of the House of Bourbon.
At home, Mr. Pitt lamented (and in which the
Duke most sincerely joined) the infringement on our
constitution in the affair of the Warrants, left still undecided,
though twice before Parliament; the army degraded,
as well as our liberties struck at, by the dismission
of officers who had taken the part in Parliament which their
consciences prompted them to, so much to their honour,
though contrary to their interest; and in addition to these,
should be taken into consideration the propriety of rewarding
the uprightness of Lord Chief Justice Pratt at such
a crisis, by giving him a peerage. To Mr. Pitt’s question
to the Duke, whether the Great Seal was promised to Mr.
Charles Yorke? his Royal Highness could only answer, that
he could not say how far the King had engaged himself
with that gentleman. The Duke did not tell me what I
afterwards heard from Mr. Pitt, that the Duke had that
day mentioned it to be the King’s <em>wish</em> to have Lord
Northumberland at the head of the Treasury. If it was
mentioned, it is very clear that it was almost as soon
dropped; and I am confident that it was not, that day, the
Duke’s desire any more than that of Mr. Pitt. In which
case, I think it was possible that it was named more to
feel Mr. Pitt’s notion or affections to that quarter, or
perhaps, by a policy very unnecessary with so great a
man, thinking it might be a concession that would please,
when he found that Lord Temple would be agreeable to
the King in that office. His Royal Highness, often, as he
told me, pressed Mr. Pitt to chalk out to the King a list
of such as he would wish to fill all the posts of business,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
which, the Duke answered for, the King would instantly
adopt. This was to no purpose; and the Duke was
obliged to return to Richmond with the unpleasant account
of his ill success.</p>

<p>The day following, the Duke, by his Majesty’s command,
was employed in endeavouring to form an Administration
without Mr. Pitt, and to that end Lord Lyttelton
was sounded, to be placed at the head of the
Treasury, with Mr. C. Townshend as the Chancellor
of the Exchequer. These gentlemen both thought the
ground too weak to stand long upon, and wished to decline
it. The latter of them accepted the Pay Office, two days
after, under the old Ministry. Many different posts were
thought of and proposed for me, during this <em>arrangement</em>,
but none of them ever came to my ears till my coming to
London, as it was unnecessary I should know of them
till the greater posts were fixed on and accepted. The
King, on the day following, disappointed of this plan also,
with his present Ministry at the door of the closet, ready
to resign, was under a difficulty, and in such a situation
that he knew not which way to turn. The Duke’s advice
then was, as the lesser evil of the two, to call in his old
Administration rather than to leave the country without
Ministers while the town was in a tumult, raised against the
Duke of Bedford by the weavers, and the House of Lords
passing the most strange as well as violent resolutions.</p>

<p>On the Wednesday morning Mr. Grenville, in the name
of the rest, acquainted the King that, before they should
again undertake his affairs, they must lay before him some
questions to be answered by his Majesty; on which the
King, taking him up, said, “<em>Terms</em>, I suppose you mean,
sir; what are they?” Mr. Grenville answered, that they
should expect further assurance that Lord Bute should
never meddle in the State affairs, of whatsoever sort; that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
Mr. Mackenzie (his brother) should be dismissed from his
employment; that Lord Holland should also meet with the
same treatment; that Lord Weymouth should be named
Lord-Lieutenant to Ireland, and that Lord Granby should
be appointed Commander-in-Chief. He then left the
King, from whom they were to have their answer the next
day. Mr. G. Grenville, on that day also, took the lead in
the name of the rest; and the King, advised by the Duke
of Cumberland, except in that point relating to himself,
told them he would never give up the possibility of employing
his uncle on an emergency, which he should do
if he put any one in the post of Commander-in-Chief; that
he assented to the others, though against his opinion; and
that he supposed they would not press him to break his
word, which he had given to Mr. Mackenzie; but that
he was ready to give up the management of the Scotch
affairs, if they would leave him in as Privy Seal to that
kingdom. On their still insisting on his total dismission,
the King was obliged to assent; and then, by their friends,
they were considered as much stronger than they ever
had been.</p>

<p>This affair being thus concluded, after having paid my
duty at the King’s levee, I returned again into the country,
and soon waited upon his Royal Highness, at Windsor Lodge,
during the races. The Duke of Cumberland was over at
Hayes the day after I went back to Wakefield Lodge; and
though Mr. Pitt had two long conferences, in consequence,
with the King, and in the latter on Saturday, May the 19th,
had expectation that a thorough change would have taken
place, according to the fullest of our wishes. Our hopes,
however, were strangely thwarted by the disinclination of
Lord Temple, who made such use of the mention of the
Earl of Northumberland for the Treasury, as to stagger
Mr. Pitt himself, as I conjectured. But the cause of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
failure of this negotiation was imputed differently, according
as the partialities and prejudices of political men led
them to represent it: that no obstacle arose from his Majesty,
I am perfectly assured. Those with whom I chiefly
consorted were much inclined to blame Mr. Pitt, who, as
they said, had <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">carte blanche</i> from the King. Mr. Pitt, on
the other hand, would not allow that this was the case;
and he observed that the expression itself was unfit to be
used on such an occasion; and Mr. J. Grenville had assured
my brother that Mr. Pitt was much hurt to find the
latter offer, <em>to which he had acceded</em>, broken off before
Mr. Pitt had returned his answer. Mr. J. Grenville added,
that the reconciliation with George Grenville did not regard
the public.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, I received a letter from my brother,
who mentioned the conversation alluded to with Mr. J.
Grenville, in which that gentleman had also declared
his own thoughts on the late negotiation, adding, that
Mr. Pitt desired much an opportunity of explaining
the whole to me. My brother pressed me strongly from
himself, as well as from Mr. Meynell and other of my
friends, to see Mr. Pitt as soon as possible, in order
that I might be able to clear up and put a stop to divisions
that this whole affair had made among friends
eager to defend the part those to whom they were most
attached had taken in it. I returned for answer to my
brother, that I must have some plainer certainty of such
a wish of Mr. Pitt’s, and that I would desire him to go
to Hayes to know whether the case was as represented,
and to lay before him my thoughts of his conduct on the
occasion, which, partial as I was to him, even to me
appeared unfathomable, and to want great explanation:
I even offered, in case of anything having been misunderstood,
that I should be too happy to be thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
worthy of being employed by him, either to get explained
or renewed a measure that appeared to me the only
one by which our King and country could attain their
ancient glory. Immediately on the receipt of my letter,
my brother went to Hayes, and having heard from Mr.
Pitt the whole relation, he transmitted the chief purport to
me that same evening in the following letters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright smaller">
“London, Wednesday, May 29.
</p>

<p class="in0">“<span class="smcap">Dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>“At the end of my conversation with Mr. Pitt, I asked
if I should write word to you that he was resolved not to
renew the negotiation; he said, <em>Resolved</em> was a <em>large</em> word,
and desired I would express myself thus: ‘<em>Mr. Pitt’s
determination was final, and the negotiation is at an end</em>.’
These are his own words. As to your coming, he shall
be extremely happy to have the honour of seeing you, but
would be ashamed to bring you to town for so little an
object; yet, if you should come to London, would not
only be proud to see you at Hayes, and talk things over,
but, if he could walk on foot to London, and pay his
respects to you, he would do it. Having said this, at your
own leisure, any time within a week or so, if you come to
London, he should think himself happy to see you at
Hayes.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l8">I am, &amp;c.,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Charles Fitzroy</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright smaller">
(Without date.)
</p>

<p class="in0">“<span class="smcap">Dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>“My other is a formal answer to my commission; this
is a private account of my conversation at Hayes, as near
as I can recollect the different heads, and shorter in substance.
Mr. Pitt two hours incessant talking. It is quite
private between us—I mean you and myself. 1st, I found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
he had not been acquainted with J. Grenville’s conversation
with me; upon my telling it to him <em>in part</em>, he said, it
might have come from Lord Temple, but that the different
periods were not exactly stated. He then went through
every part of what had passed, and made his remarks with
several refinements upon <em>manner</em> and <em>words</em>, and often declared
his unwillingness to engage again in office. He rested
the whole objections of this negotiation upon the transactions,
opening with the King’s wish to have Lord Northumberland
at the head of the Treasury: at the same
time he expressed that he, <em>Mr. Pitt</em>, did not desire Lord
Temple should be there; but that he thought the whole
transaction a phantom, and could never have been intended
serious. He declared it impossible for him and his Royal
Highness to talk a different language as to fact, but that
nothing like <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">carte blanche</i> was ever hinted. (N.B.—he
thinks that an improper phrase, as it sounds like capitulating.)
He talked much of Revolution, families <em>personally</em>
from their weight but unconnected and under no
banner. For all <em>that</em> was factious. He mentioned the great
popular points: restitution of officers, privileges, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
change of system of politics, both domestic and foreign;
said everything you would like, and resolved nothing but
retirement. I must add the highest commendations of his
Royal Highness, his judgment, abilities, integrity, &amp;c., &amp;c.;
but said, that ‘no man in England but himself would
have brought such terms,—no, not even Lord Bute.’ He
left me totally in the dark, further than I could easily distinguish
he thinks that it was not meant to have it <em>his</em>
Administration.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, see him! it must not be to-morrow, as
he has his reconciling dinner with George Grenville:
<em>this he told me</em>. The Duke of Cumberland goes to the
birthday, so you may come on Monday, if you will,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
to see Mr. Pitt, and take the birthday on Tuesday, if
you like it. Adieu.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">Yours,</span><br />
“C. F. R.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>It was not to be wondered at, if his Majesty, under
these circumstances, was led to try every practical means
by which he could form an Administration capable of
relieving him from the irksome situation in which he stood
with his present servants. Among others, I was myself
commanded by the King, through the Duke of Cumberland,
to wait on Mr. Pitt at Hayes, and to bear to him his
Majesty’s wishes to be informed what steps would be the
fittest for his Majesty to take in order to constitute an
Administration of which Mr. Pitt was to be the head, and
which might, through a confidence of the principles and
abilities of the other Ministers, give satisfaction to his
people. His Royal Highness told me, that if I had any
doubt as to the authority, I might receive it from the
King himself.</p>

<p>I was young and unsuspicious, and, moreover, perfectly
relied on the honour of those who were then present at
this conference at Windsor Great Lodge, when the King’s
commands were communicated to me; and I desired no
other authority. Since that time, experience would probably
have stopped me from undertaking a commission so
critical, and, I may add, so hazardous; yet I received the
satisfactory declaration from all parties, that I had discharged
my commission faithfully.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt received me with the usual kindness which I had
constantly met with from him ever since he first knew me at
Stowe, when I was a boy from school; indeed, his obliging
attention had been daily increasing. He appeared to be
much pleased with the subject of the message I brought.
He talked over many weighty political considerations and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
situations in a very open manner; some of which were to
be considered as going no further than my own breast.
The rest I was desired to report. In a visit of more than
two hours, he concluded, that with every sense of duty
to his Majesty for his obliging condescension, he could not,
but to the King himself, state his views, and what would
be his advice for the King’s dignity and the public
welfare.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt did see the King in a day or two after this,
and again on June the 22nd. But, alas! it will appear
by the following letters, that he was much disappointed in
the warm expectation he had formed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright smaller">
“Pall Mall, Saturday, June 22d, 1765.
</p>

<p class="in0">“<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>“Having had an audience again to-day of his Majesty
at the Queen’s house, I find myself under a necessity of

messenger to Wakefield Lodge; as it is, I trust your
Grace will, in consideration of my sincere respect and
attachment, pardon the great liberty I take in desiring
that your Grace would take the trouble of a journey to
town. I am going to sleep at Hayes, where I find it
necessary for me to be, as much as may be, for the air;
and shall be proud and happy to have the honour of waiting
on your Grace, at my return to London, Monday
night, in case you should be then arrived,—or some time
on Tuesday next. A letter would but ill convey what I
have to impart; I therefore defer entering into matter till
I have the satisfaction of meeting; and will only say, that
I think the Royal dispositions are most propitious to the
wishes of the public, with regard to <em>measures</em> most likely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
to spread satisfaction. When your Grace arrives, you will
hear with your own ears, and see with your own eyes,
which will be better than any lights I can convey. I have

</p></blockquote>

<p>Despairing of receiving Mr. Pitt’s assistance at our head,
a new plan for establishing a Ministry was proposed to his
Majesty by his Royal Highness, and accepted; several,
with myself, understanding that it came forward with the
full declaration of our desire to receive Mr. Pitt at our
head, <em>whenever</em> he should see the situation of affairs to be
such as to allow him to take that part. My concern
afterwards was great, when I found, before the conclusion
of our first session, that this idea was already vanished
from the minds of some of my colleagues. I always understood
this to be the ground on which I engaged, and
it will be seen that I adhered to my own resolution to the
last.</p>

<p>When the principal line of ministerial departments was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
settled between his Majesty and his Royal Highness, a
considerable number of the leading men in both Houses
were invited to a great dinner, at whose house I do not
exactly recollect, where the great officers were to be fixed
on, as much as possible to the general satisfaction of the
meeting as to the person himself. A real difficulty, however,
arose concerning the Treasury; for the delicacy of
Lord Rockingham kept him back for some time from
accepting that post, to which the Duke of Newcastle was
giving up the claim reluctantly, though most of his own
friends felt that his advanced age rendered him inadequate
to fill it. After long resistance, the Marquis yielded;
and the other offices were nearly agreed upon, as we kissed
hands for them on the 10th of July.</p>

<h3>EXTRACT II.</h3>

<p>The internal state of the country was really alarming;
and from my situation I had more cause to feel it than
any other man. But a measure at this time adopted by a
majority of the King’s servants gave me still more apprehension,
considering it to be big with more mischief; for,
contrary to my proposal of including the articles of teas,
together with all the other trifling objects of taxation, to be
repealed on the opening of the next session, it was decided
that the teas were still to remain taxed as before, though
contrary to the declared opinions of Lord Camden, Lord
Granby, General Conway, and myself. Sir Edward
Hawke was absent through illness: otherwise I think
he would have agreed with those who voted for including
the teas in the repeal. But this was not all; and considering
what important consequences this very decision led<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
to, there is no minute part of it on which you should not
be informed.</p>

<p>When we had delivered <em>seriatim</em> our opinions, the
minute, as is usual, was taken down by Lord Hillsborough;
and in that part where the intentions of the
King’s servants were to be communicated by a circular
letter to all the Governors in America, the majority
allowed the first penned minute of Lord Hillsborough to
be amended by words as kind and lenient as could be proposed
by some of us, and not without encouraging expressions
which were too evidently displeasing to his Lordship.
The quick departure of the packet carried off Lord Hillsborough’s
circular letter before it had got into circulation,
and we were persuaded, on reading the dispatch attentively,
that it was not in the words nor form of the last correction
agreed to by the Cabinet. Thus it was evident to us,
who were overruled in the Cabinet, that the parts of the
minute which might be soothing to the Colonies were
wholly omitted. Lord Camden, in particular, much offended
at this proceeding, mentioned the circumstance to
me, and immediately charged Lord Hillsborough with the
omission, and insisted on seeing the minute from which
the circular letter ought to have been drawn. Lord Hillsborough
expressed his sorrow that the packet was sailed;
but that he was certain that the circular was drawn conformably
to the minute.</p>

<p>The present Lord Camden gave me leave to copy
the following papers, which passed between his father
and Lord Hillsborough on this occasion, and which I had
particularly desired his Lordship to search for from among
his father’s papers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span></p>

<blockquote>

conduct of the King’s servants in respect to the dispute

the draught which came first to his hands the day before

<p>“I had the honour of receiving your Lordship’s note

Letter, though I have considered and considered it with
the utmost attention.</p>

<p>“I wish your Lordship had not mislaid the original Minute;
however, I do not remember the first sentence of the
fair draught to have been part of that original, and so I
told your Lordship when you were pleased to show me the
draught a day or two after the meeting. All that I mean to
observe to your Lordship upon that subject is, that this
sentence was not a part of the original Minute, nor in my
poor judgment necessary to have been made a part of it.</p>

<p>“But the principal objection, wherein I possibly may be
mistaken, is to the Letter, which ought to have been
founded on the Minute, and it is this, that the Letter does
not communicate that opinion which is expressed in the
second paragraph of the Minute, and which the Secretary
of State is authorized to impart both by his conversation
and correspondence.</p>

<p>“The communication of that opinion was the measure;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
if that has not been made, the measure has not been
pursued, and therefore your Lordship will forgive me for
saying, that though I am responsible for the Minute as it
was taken down, I am not for the Letter.</p>

<p>“I confess that I do not expect this Letter will give much
satisfaction to America; perhaps the Minute might: but as
the opportunity of trying what effect that might have produced
is lost, I can only say that I am sorry it was not in

<p>“What his Majesty is pleased to say, in relation to the

will not escape your notice, as the satisfaction his Majesty

them, and the assurance of their firm support in the prosecution

great advantages that will probably accrue from the concurrence

tend to remove the prejudices which have been excited by

<p>This unfortunate and unwarrantable Letter (to give it no
harsher epithet) of Lord Hillsborough to the Governors in
the different Colonies, was, many years after, the subject of
discourse between Lord Camden and myself. This Circular
was calculated to do all mischief, when our real
Minute might have paved the way to some good. Besides
many other objectionable points, how could Lord Hillsborough
venture to assert in the first line of this Letter
the word <em>unanimous</em>? for he could not have so soon forgotten
that there was but one single voice for the measure
more than was the number of those who were against it.</p>

<p>You will readily imagine that on this defeat in the
Cabinet I considered myself no longer possessed of that
weight which had been allowed to me before in these
meetings, especially as the proposal was on a matter of
finance, more particularly belonging to my department.
My resolution was soon taken to withdraw myself from my
office, which was become very uncomfortable and irksome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
to me, on the first favourable opportunity that offered.
The resistance to any further steps calculated to alienate
the Colonies would probably have furnished good ground
for my retreat; but, while I remained in office, none was
proposed. I had occasion, however, to look about me,
and to tread my way with more wary steps than I had
hitherto done. It led me plainly to perceive that from
the time of Lord Camden’s altercation with Lord Hillsborough,
the former Minister had sunk much in the royal
estimation. As to myself, there was no alteration in his
Majesty’s condescending goodness; but though this was
not diminished, I was sensible that his Majesty was more
forward to dictate his will to me, than to inquire first my
opinion on any measure that was to be considered, as had
been his usual practice. My tame submission to be overruled
in Cabinet might give the King’s friends an idea that
I might be more pliant, and rest my favour on their support.
But they knew me little who thus judged of my temper;
nor did they imagine that an honourable liberation from
the Treasury was of all others the thought on which I indulged
my hope. To have offered to resign while the
spirit of petitioning was so violent in many counties, would
have been highly blameable in me; for the petitions were
directed against the Administration and the Parliament,
which had supported us. Other causes brought forward
my resignation, and at a time when the sting of these
petitions was no longer so much to be feared.</p>

<p>On the 24th of June, 1769, I married Elizabeth, third
daughter of Sir Richard and Lady Mary Wrottesley, whose
merit as a wife, tenderness and affection as a mother of a
numerous family, and exemplary conduct through life, need
not be related to you. In a week or ten days after I went
from Woburn, accompanied by the Duke of Bedford, to the
installation at Cambridge, where, in the preceding year, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
the death of the Duke of Newcastle, the University had
done me the honour of electing me as Chancellor to succeed
his Grace. That ceremony being over, I returned
to London, where I first heard that Lord Chatham was so
well recovered as to be expected to attend the King’s next
levee. Lord Camden had seen him, and, I think, the day
before his appearing mentioned to me Lord Chatham’s
intention. Lord Camden informed me that he was far
from being well pleased, but did not enter into particulars,
except that he considered my marriage to be quite political;
and it was without effect that Lord Chancellor
laboured to assure him that it was otherwise, and that he
could answer that I was as desirous as ever of seeing his
Lordship again taking the lead in the King’s Administration.</p>

<p>This neglect on the part of Lord Chatham piqued
me much. I had surely a claim to some notice on his
recovery, when at his earnest solicitation I embarked in an
arduous post when he was incapable of business of any
sort; and if Lord Chatham wished to receive the state of
political matters, I hope that it is not saying too much
that he ought to have requested it of me. He chose the
contrary; and even in the King’s outer-room, where we
met before the levee, when I went up to him with civility
and ease, he received me with cold politeness; and from
St. James’s called and left his name at my door.</p>

<p>On my returning home I took down a minute of this
occurrence of the day, which I have preserved. It runs
<span class="locked">thus:—</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright smaller">
“July 7, 1769.
</p>

<p>“Lord Chatham waited on the King for the first time
since his long confinement, was graciously received at the
levee, and was desired to stay after it was over, when the
King sent for him into the closet. His Majesty took the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
opportunity of assuring him how much he was concerned
that the ill state of his health had been the occasion of his
quitting the King’s service. His Lordship answered, that
his Majesty must feel that in his infirm state he must
have stood under the most embarrassing difficulties, holding
an office of such consequence, and unable to give his
approbation to measures that he thought salutary, or his
dissent to those which appeared to him to have another
tendency; that he was unwilling to go into particulars;
yet he could not think that one especially had been
managed in the manner it might have been, for if it had
been despised thoroughly at the outset, it never could
have been attended with the disagreeable consequences
which have happened, but that it was too late now to look
back.</p>

<p>“The Indian transaction was also found fault with. His
Lordship, besides, observed, that their general courts were
got upon the worst of footings, exercising the conduct of
little parliaments; that he wondered that the inspectors
were not sent to three different places. There were also
other observations on the head of India. His Lordship
added, that he doubted whether his health would ever
again allow him to attend Parliament; but if it did, and if
he should give his dissent to any measure, that his Majesty
would be indulgent enough to believe that it would not
arise from any personal consideration; for, he protested to
his Majesty, as Lord Chatham, he had not a tittle to find
fault with in the conduct of any one individual, and that
his Majesty might be assured that it could not arise from
ambition, as he felt so strongly the weak state from which
he was recovering, and which might daily threaten him,
that office, therefore, of any sort could no longer be desireable
to him.”</p></blockquote>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>From this time until the meeting of Parliament I saw no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
more of Lord Chatham. His suspicions of me were probably
too firmly rooted to be removed by Lord Camden’s
assurances that they were groundless. His Lordship
desired no further interview; and I had such a sense of the
unkindness and injustice of such a treatment, when I
thought that I had a claim for the most friendly, that I was
not disposed to seek any explanation.</p>

<p>Lord Camden and myself, unfortunately, saw less of each
other than in other summers; both of us profiting, by a
retreat into the country, of the leisure which a recess from
Chancery and Treasury business offered. The affair of
petitions was becoming every day more serious, increasing
in number; the consequences were ever uppermost in my
thoughts. Mr. Stonehewer and a few friends were with us
at Wakefield Lodge; with them I conversed much on all
that I foresaw of mischief from these intemperate petitions,
and I shall lay before you the copy, which I have in Mr.
Stonehewer’s hand-writing, of the letter which I wrote,
wishing to consult Lord Camden, the lawyer as well as the
friend from whom I might expect the soundest advice,
well convinced that his to me came on all occasions from
the sincerity of his heart.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright smaller">
“Wakefield Lodge, August 29, 1769.
</p>

<p class="in0">“<span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>“I have made use of the leisure which the Treasury
holidays have given me to revolve over here in quiet such
points as our duty seemed to call upon us, as public men,
most to give attention to. The petitions, I must say, have
greatly engrossed and puzzled my thoughts; indeed, the
conduct on this strange occasion, which has been stirred up
by the envy and malice of Opposition, without a single
thought on its pernicious consequences hereafter, appears
to me to be most delicate indeed.</p>

<p>“I am alarmed, I own to your Lordship, at the mischief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
that may from this source, before it is long, arise
to this constitution, which those who are now in office
will heartily, I am convinced, join in endeavours to
deliver down to their successors as pure as they received
it. No trouble will stop us in this purpose, and most
essential part our duty; nor shall we be afraid to wade
through the rage of popular clamour for the moment, if on
consideration any effort of that sort shall appear to be
necessary. I am not easy in my mind, nor can I be so
until I know at bottom what are the penalties these gentlemen
who have been the promoters of these steps have
made themselves liable to, or how far they are criminal.
When we have this from authority the King’s servants will
consider the <em>State part</em> of it, how far the petitions themselves
can be allowed to sleep without some notice, having
been delivered to, and of course known to, the Crown,—especially
as the matter of these petitions is defamatory of
Parliament itself, and may perhaps prove to be a violation
of the constitution. I profess to your Lordship openly,
that I do not see how they can lie wholly locked up in an
office, and no farther produced or mentioned.</p>

<p>“My thoughts have been running on this business both
day and night. I wish but to do right, and shall never be
afraid to meet difficulty on <em>good ground</em>; and some there
must be if an active measure is resolved upon: but believe
me, that great part of that vanishes when a measure, of
itself right, is known to be cordially approved of and determined
by the King’s principal servants. If nothing is to
be done, and that it shall be thought most judicious to let
the consideration wholly drop, for God’s sake let it not be
before every point relating to it shall have been maturely
weighed by us! Let it not be said that innovations of a
dangerous tendency, injurious to Parliament and dangerous
to the constitution, have been established in these times,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
because the Ministers have not attended to the nature of
them, or have been too inactive to resist such wicked
measures.</p>

<p>“This subject is too much and too closely connected
with the laws, and indeed with the very being, in my
opinion, of this constitution, for me not to want the
advice and assistance of those who love it as much as
myself, and who know it so infinitely more. It was a disappointment
to me not to meet your Lordship during the
four days of last week which I passed in London. My
mind was too full for me not to trouble you with this
letter. Be so good as to give me your thoughts on the <em>present
state</em> of this weighty business; they will greatly relieve
mine, although they can only be your thoughts on the
<em>present</em> state of it, as I feel that it is not prepared nor
digested enough to be yet decided upon. The Middlesex
and the City petitions your Lordship has seen; Surrey
has now gone to the grievances only of the right of election
violated, as they complain. One will come from Worcester,
and in Wiltshire the <em>pardon of the chairman</em> is
added,—the petition mostly encouraged by our old friends
Popham and Beckford; others will probably come.</p>

<p>“The opinion in form of the King’s servants will of course
be taken, if any proceeding is to be entered upon. I have
desired in my case a person under me to be collecting the
different facts and proofs; if not wanted by them, they
will be satisfactory to myself.</p>

<p>“You know the difficulties we have had about the Board
of Trade Council; I will submit this arrangement to you,
and if your Lordship approves of it, I think that I can
bring the <em>whole</em> about if I have your leave to <em>try</em>. Mr.
Justice Clive’s infirmities render it indispensable for the
King to make him the usual provision on retiring; he
might even be told that some gentlemen who have felt the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
inconvenience of it have determined to move in Parliament
what would be most disagreeable to him, and would in fact
reflect on us. Indeed, my dear Lord, I hear from all
quarters the necessity of this. Moreton might succeed
him; Thurlow to him; and our friend Jackson come to the
post of all others I most wish to see him in. Will you
allow me to set about it? It requires some management,
but I think if left to myself I shall succeed.</p>

<p>“I have already made this too long a letter to trouble
your Lordship with further particulars on this second
subject.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l2">“I have the honour to be, &amp;c.,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Grafton</span>.

is recovered.”</p></blockquote>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Though I have inserted this letter of mine, I should
certainly wish to correct some sentiments therein expressed.
You will partake in my disappointment, I am confident,
when I acquaint you that I have no opinion to lay before
you from this eminent and constitutional lawyer, whose
sentiments on so peculiar a state of things, as well as his
advice how to proceed upon them, would have been so
satisfactory to myself at the time, and to the world in
every age. But to deliver, on recollection only, the sentiments
of a man of his high character and authority on so
serious a subject, would be in me arrogant, and little suited
to that respect I shall ever attach to the memory of my
friend.</p>

<p>Lord Camden’s answer to my letter was in these
<span class="locked">words:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“<span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>“I have the honour of your Grace’s letter, which I have

subject being new and unexpected, I am not able at present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
to form any opinion till I have given it a further consideration;
and I should be unwilling to commit my crude
thoughts to paper, which indeed would not be worth your
Grace’s perusal, and which perhaps I might change myself
upon second thoughts. As I am not honoured with any
intercourse with any of the King’s servants, except now
and then with your Grace, I should be very glad to have a
personal interview with your Grace, when we should both
be able to explain ourselves with more freedom and confidence
than can be uttered or communicated by letter. I
go to-day to Camden Place, and except a short excursion
or two to Deal, and into Sussex, shall remain there till the
10th, the day for proroguing the Parliament. So that if your
Grace will honour me with an appointment, I will wait on
you in London, at your own time and place, when I shall
be ready to communicate my poor opinions to your Grace,
as well on the main article of your letter, as the law
arrangement which your Grace is pleased to propose.</p>

<p>“I am much obliged to your Grace for inquiring after my

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The only remark I shall make on this letter is, that it
was less cordial than any Lord Camden ever wrote to me
either before or since. The coolness between Lord
Chatham and myself gave him much vexation, and the
general posture of affairs increased his uneasiness. We
met in London about the middle of September, and
after a long and general consideration of all that appertained
to the petitions, and how far they gave necessary
ground for more special notice, we agreed that in the disposition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
of the nation it would be wise to avoid, if possible,
every step that could irritate; and that to leave the spirit to
evaporate, as there were hopes that it might, would be the
most expedient measure to adopt.</p>

<p>His Majesty had been graciously pleased at this time to
summon a Chapter of the Garter, in order to invest me with
the insignia of the Order; and the King did me the honour
to observe, that he was pleased to have the greater satisfaction
in conferring that favour, as I was one of the very few
who had received it unsolicited. The Order of the Garter
is a high distinction still, though certainly it is somewhat
dropped from the ancient celebrity by the addition that was
made to the number of the Knights some years after this.</p>

<p>In this month we were involved in a very serious and
delicate business, which appeared at one time to be big with
alarming consequences. A French frigate had come into
the Downs without paying the compliment to his Majesty’s
ships which the general instructions from the Admiralty
to all commanders of ships direct them to require; but with
which no nation except the Dutch ever complied,—and
they in consequence of a treaty. An officer from a King’s
ship went on board the French frigate, remonstrating with
the commander on his conduct, and assuring him that he
must insist on the compliment; but, meeting with no
satisfactory answer, the lieutenant of our ship soon fired
his first shot a-head of the French ship, and on perceiving
no notice to be taken of his gun, he fired into the Frenchman
with ball, and, as it was said, killed one of the men.</p>

<p>The proceeding was warmly resented by the Court of
France, who required the fullest satisfaction for the affront,
together with the dismissal <em>from the service</em> of <em>the officer</em>
who had presumed, in time of perfect peace, to fire into a
frigate belonging to the French King. Office papers were
ransacked for precedents to justify the claim; few were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
found, and the paucity of these did not assist our cause.
From the reign of Charles the Second, when a long and
serious altercation took place on a similar occasion, and
which may be found in the Memoirs of M. d’Estrades,
and of his embassy here, one single instance (except the
present) was found. This instance fell out while the Duke
of Newcastle was Secretary of State, who had, on the complaint
of the French Court, recommended to his late Majesty
to break Lieutenant (afterwards Admiral) Smith: as soon
as the Ambassador had acquainted his Court, Mr. Smith
was restored to rank, and quickly promoted.</p>

<p>Finding that there was so little ground on precedent, it
became our duty, as Ministers of the Crown, to get rid of
this unpleasant incident in the best manner we were able,
provided the national honour, and that of the flag, should
not suffer in the explanation. Lord Weymouth reported
to the Cabinet that, in the audience which he gave M.
de Châtelet, his reply upon every memorial, and his language
every day became more resolute, by insisting on a
suitable satisfaction for the affront which had been done
to the King, his master’s dignity. It was Lord Weymouth’s
opinion also, that if we could find out some expedient,
at the same time to save our own credit, the
Ambassador would close with it. Lord Weymouth thought,
from my knowledge of M. de Châtelet, that I might
<em>unofficially</em> hold with him a language tending to bring
about an arrangement which might save the honour of both
parties. At the desire of the Cabinet I undertook it, hoping
that Sir Edward Hawke would call on me the next morning,
and state fully to me what, in his opinion, would, and
what would not, save the honour of the navy and the lustre
of the British flag.</p>

<p>In point of justice not one word can be said; but
it may be a question whether the ideal sovereignty of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
the narrow seas be not essential in elevating the
enthusiastic courage of our seamen; though they have
now, in the year I am writing, and, I hope, will ever have
the best of pleas, from their own incredible superiority
in skill and bravery over those of any other country.</p>

<p>The morning after the meeting of the King’s servants,
Sir Edward called on me early, and, in a long conversation,
we discussed every means that could be devised to answer
the present purpose; and at length agreed upon one
expedient, of which I made successful use in my visit
to the French Ambassador, on whom I called directly,
and began by stating to him the object of my visit, namely,
to endeavour, by a frank and open conversation with him,
to hit off some means of preventing a breach between
our two countries; and, in the course of our interview,
I desired him, particularly, not to allow himself to be
led away with false notions of the disposition of our
country from the specimen he had observed of the disposition
to riot and disorder, and to give me credit, when
I assured him that all these would vanish on the breaking
out of a war, especially on ground so popular as that of
the honour of the flag, to carry which on with spirit every
Englishman would part with his last shilling. He replied,
that peace was the object of his wish, as much as I had
professed it to be mine. Besides, recapitulating all that
had passed with Lord Weymouth, he would impart this
to me, as Duke of Grafton, “that nothing could urge
Louis the Fifteenth into another war, except where his
honour was concerned, and that he personally felt the
present affront most sensibly;” he added, “that M. de
Choiseul’s interest would suffer greatly by a war, and that
he would show his disposition to avoid it, if such did present
itself.”</p>

<p>The Ambassador proposed various schemes for reconciliation;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
but none of them came within my own notions
of what might have been admissible by the nation. Those
which I first mentioned met with no better reception
from M. de Châtelet; and, after a long parley of two
hours, we were near parting, when I thought I might
lay before him, as the only means, the very proposal I had
settled with Sir Edward Hawke. It was this, that the
answer to the French King’s complaint, should be, to say
that his Majesty could not do so great an injustice to a
lieutenant in his service, as to punish him without hearing
his account of this unfortunate transaction; and that, the
officer having now sailed to the East Indies, such an account
could not be obtained till the return of the lieutenant.
I added, to M. de Châtelet, that his return would
not be expected for three years, when the affair might
be supposed to have slipped into oblivion. The Ambassador,
after a little consideration, told me that he liked
the proposal, and would do his endeavours to make it
palatable to the Duc de Choiseul.</p>

<p>This arrangement succeeded so fully, that we have
never heard one word more of the business, since the expedient
was accepted. I do not know that I was ever so
much elated as, in my walk home, turning in my thoughts
the effects of my visit, and reflecting on the misery which
probably would be warded off from the heads of so many
individuals and families. I cannot give too full testimony
of the candour and zeal with which the Ambassador took
up the business, and recommended the expedient to his
Court; his influence prevailed, and the recollection of this
conduct increased my concern on hearing of the horrid
death of him and his amiable lady upon a scaffold, during
the frenzy of the Revolutions in France.</p>

<p>You recollect, my dear Euston, the resolution I had
formed of retiring from my situation, whenever I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
find the moment favourable; as, also, my remark on the
visible and rapid decline of my friend Lord Camden’s
favour at St. James’s. This latter circumstance served
to confirm me strongly in the former; for I was not
so blinded, as not to feel the ground around me to be
treacherous and unsafe. Though the closet was still favourable
and afforded all apparent support, yet I probably
owed it to those to whom my principles could never be
quite congenial, and who might, on some occasion where
we differed, show to me my presumption and my insignificance,
particularly as they expressed their attachment
strongly, because <em>I was emancipated from the chains of Lord
Chatham and the burthen of Lord Camden</em>.</p>

<p>Parliament was to meet on the 9th of January, 1770.
The necessity of having a Chancellor to vindicate the law
authority of the Cabinet was dinned into my ears in most
companies I frequented; and it was particularly remarked,
that Mr. Charles Yorke had taken no part in the whole
business of the Middlesex election that need preclude him
from joining in opinion with the decisions of the Commons.
Such insinuations were very irksome to me; and, about
the Court, I was still more harassed with them. At last,
when I was passing a few Christmas holidays at Euston,
Lords Gower and Weymouth came down on a visit. They
informed me, that the King, on hearing their intention
of going to Euston, had expressly directed them to say,
that the continuance of the Lord Chancellor in his office
could not be justified, and that the Government would
be too much lowered by the Great Seal appearing in
Opposition, and his Majesty hoped that I should assent
to his removal, and approve of an offer being made to
Mr. Yorke. My answer, as well as I recollect, was,
that, though it did not become me to argue against his
Majesty’s remarks on the present peculiar state of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
Great Seal, I must humbly request that I might be in no
way instrumental in dismissing Lord Camden.</p>

<p>In a few days after my arrival in London, the session
opened, when the Lord Chancellor spoke warmly in support
of Lord Chatham’s opposition to the address, and,
while we were in the House, Lord Camden told me, that
he was sensible that the Seal must be taken from him,
though he had no intention to resign it. At St.
James’s, it was at once decided that the Seal should be
demanded; but, at my request, Lord Camden held it on
for some days, merely for the convenience of Government,
during the negotiation for a respectable successor. No
person will deny that Mr. Charles Yorke, Sir Eardley
Wilmot, and Mr. De Grey, would any of them have filled
the high office of Lord Chancellor with the full approbation
of Westminster Hall. They were all three thought of
for it, though Sir Eardley’s impaired state of health,
accompanied by an humble diffidence of himself, which had
been a distinguishing mark in his character through life,
forbad all hopes of his acceptance.</p>

<p>While I continued in office, it was my duty, as well as
desire, to exert myself in endeavouring to render the
King’s Administration as respectable as I was able.
Though I lamented and felt grievously the loss of Lord
Camden’s support, from which I derived so much comfort
and assistance, yet I was satisfied that the lawyers
I have mentioned were men equal to discharge the duties
of a Chancellor. I therefore received the King’s commands
to write to Mr. Yorke directly. I saw him the
next day. He received the offer of the Great Seal with
much gratitude to his Majesty, but hoped that he should
be allowed to return his answer when he should have
given it a day’s consideration. Mr. Charles Yorke remained
with me between two and three hours, dwelling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
much on the whole of his own political thoughts and conduct,
together with a comment on the principal public
occurrences of the present reign. When he came to make
remarks on the actual state of things, after speaking with
much regard of many in Administration, he said, that it
was essential to him to be informed from me, whether
I was open to a negotiation for extending the Administration,
so as to comprehend those with whom I had formerly,
and he constantly, wished to agree. My answer was, that
he could not desire more earnestly than myself to see an
Administration as comprehensive as possible, and that this
object could only be brought about by the reunion of the
Whigs, adding, that I should be happy to have his assistance
to effect it. Mr. Yorke appeared to be pleased with
this answer, and, after many civilities on both sides, we
parted.</p>

<p>On his return to me, the next day, I found him
a quite altered man, for his mind was then made up to
decline the offer from his Majesty, and that so decidedly,
that I did not attempt to say anything further on the
subject. He expressed, however, a wish to be allowed
an audience of his Majesty. This was granted, and, at
the conclusion of it, the King, with the utmost concern,
wrote to acquaint me that Mr. Yorke had declined the
Seal. On his appearing soon after at the levee, his Majesty
called him into his closet immediately after it was
over. What passed there I know not; but nothing could
exceed my astonishment, when Lord Hillsborough came
into my dressing-room, in order to tell me that Mr. Yorke
was in my parlour, and that he was Lord Chancellor,
through the persuasion of the King himself in his closet.
Mr. Yorke corroborated to me what I had heard from
Lord Hillsborough, and I received the same account from
his Majesty as soon as I could get down to St. James’s.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
Mr. Yorke stayed but a little time with me; but his language
gave me new hopes that an Administration might
shortly be produced which the nation would approve. How
soon did this plausible hope vanish into a visionary expectation
only, from the death of Mr. Yorke before he
became Lord Morden, or we could have any preliminary
discourse on the measure he earnestly desired to forward!</p>

<p>I had long been acquainted with Mr. Yorke, and held
him in high esteem. He certainly appeared less easy and
communicative with me, from the time of his acceptance
to his death, than I might expect; but it was natural to
imagine that he would be more agitated than usual, when
arduous and intricate business was rushing at once upon
him. I had not the least conception of any degree of
agitation that could bring him to his sad and tragical end;
nor will I presume to conjecture what motives in his
own breast, or anger in that of others, had driven him
to repent of the step he had just taken. By his own
appointment, I went to his house, about nine o’clock in
the evening,—two days, as I believe, after Mr Yorke had
been sworn in at a Council-board, summoned for that
purpose at the Queen’s house. Being shown into his
library below, I waited a longer time than I supposed
Mr. Yorke would have kept me, without some extraordinary
cause. After above half-an-hour waiting, Dr. Watson,
his physician, came into the room; he appeared somewhat
confused, sat himself down for a few minutes, letting
me know that Mr. Yorke was much indisposed from an
attack of colic. Dr. Watson soon retired, and I was
ruminating on the untowardness of the circumstance, never
suspecting the fatal event which had occurred, nor the still
more lamentable cause ascribed for it by the world, and, as
I fear, upon too just grounds. I rang the bell, and acquainted
one of the servants that Mr. Yorke was probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
too ill to see me, and that I should postpone the business
on which I came to a more favourable moment. Mr.
Yorke, I believe, was a religious man: it is rare to hear
of such a person being guilty of an action so highly criminal.
It must, therefore, in him have been a degree of
passionate frenzy, bearing down every atom of his reason:
you will not wonder that I cannot think on the subject
without much horror still.</p>

<p>Here I stood again, under more perplexing difficulties
than ever, and without any expectation of additional
strength, but what would arise alone from the appointment
of an able Chancellor. Lord Chief Justice Wilmot,
after Mr. Yorke’s death, declined the acceptance of the
Great Seal, from the causes I have already assigned.
Under these unpromising circumstances, I still persisted
in endeavouring to fill up the vacant Chancellor’s post
by an efficient and respected character. By the King’s
commands, I saw Mr. De Grey, a most able and upright
lawyer, and as perfect a gentleman, and who afterwards
became Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. In
a long conference we had at his house, he appeared inclined
to undertake the situation, in spite of his frequent
attacks of gout. But, on entering something further into
particulars, he put this question to me, “Are you determined
yourself to remain a certain time in your present
post?” My answer decided him at once to decline, for
I told him that I thought of retiring as soon as I could
reconcile it to my own heart, and that I foresaw this might
be very near at hand indeed, for I assured him that I
should not seek for any other Chancellor, if he refused
the offer of the Great Seal.</p>

<p>You will feel for me in this distressing dilemma. You
will perceive that I had left nothing untried to bring the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
vessel to tolerable trim; and, when you consider that,
quitted by Lord Camden, and at the same time by Lord
Granby, I had no reliance in the Cabinet but on General
Conway alone, I trust you will think that, under such
circumstances, I could not proceed and be of service
to the King or to the country; and recollect that the
hopes of co-operation with Mr. Yorke, to bring about an
essential addition of right principle, credit, and support,
vanished of course with himself. I laid before his Majesty
directly my difficulties, and observed that they were such
as compelled me to retire from my office, though it would
be my full desire to give all assistance to his Majesty’s
Government. As it would be thoroughly ungrateful to
pass over entirely the concern his Majesty manifested
on this occasion, I am induced to observe that the King’s
earnestness with me to alter my resolution, far surpassed
everything which my poor services could possibly have
merited.</p>

<p>Towards the end of January, 1770, I left the Treasury,
but continued to give the Administration under
Lord North what support I was able. The number of
independent gentlemen, members chiefly of the House of
Commons, who came to me at this juncture, expressing
their desire of taking their part with me, both surprised
and flattered me, for many of the number were little
known to me. I returned them many thanks for the
honour they did me by this proof of their good opinion,
which I should never forget, though my mind was made
up, as I told them, to keep myself as single and independent
as a political man could be.</p>

<p>At this time, Lord Chatham’s virulence seemed to be
directed against myself; he persisted, for some days, in the
intention of charging me in Parliament with having advised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
the removal of Lord Camden, on account of his vote
in the House; nor was he dissuaded from this, till Lord
Camden had assured him that he knew so perfectly that
the advice did not come from me, that he should, if his
Lordship made the motion, think it incumbent on him
to rise in his place, and declare that he well knew it
was not from my advice. This idea was wholly dropped
in our House on this declaration from Lord Camden,
but I think that some member of the House of Commons
made a motion of the same tendency, but met with no
support.</p>

<p>In the last days of January, Lord Rockingham moved
for a day to be fixed when he should enter upon the consideration
of the state of the nation. Lord Chatham
meant to be the seconder, but I started up myself to
second Lord Rockingham, and to profess my readiness
and wish to go into any inquiry that the House should
approve. On the day fixed, the Marquis made his motion,
which related wholly to the rights of the Commons
on judicial authority in matters of election. In debate,
arguments went further; and, in particular, Lord Chatham
condemned the conduct of the Commons with much asperity,
in a speech which betrayed no want of mental or
bodily powers. A great majority supported the Ministers,
and Lord Marchmont made the following motion, which
was not only approved, but said to be penned by Lord
Mansfield himself, who gave it his fullest support, in
a very brilliant speech:—“That any resolution of this
House, directly or indirectly impeaching a judgment of
the House of Commons, in a matter where their jurisdiction
is competent, final, and conclusive, would be a violation
of the constitutional right of the Commons, tends
to make a breach between the two Houses of Parliament,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
and leads to a general confusion.” This motion was, as I
thought, highly necessary, and it received my fullest support.
Lord Chatham continued, for two months together,
in a more active opposition to the Ministry than I had
ever known in his Lordship, and, after many motions,
which were all negatived, he moved an address to his
Majesty to dissolve the Parliament, on the ground that
the people had no confidence in the House of Commons,
at a time when the discontents in England, Ireland, and
America were threatening to a high degree. This motion
was rejected, as you may imagine, without much debate,
and by Administration with little attention.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1771, the Duke of Grafton was again
induced to join the Administration, and he accepted the
Privy Seal in the hope that he might prevent the quarrel
with America from proceeding to extremities. But when
he discovered that, in opposition to his earnest remonstrances,
Government resisted all conciliation, were determined
upon coercive measures, and would pay no regard
even to the petition brought over by Mr. Penn in 1775,
which was emphatically called the Olive Branch; and
finally withdrew from that Administration; and having, in
a private audience, explained to the Monarch his views of
the state and dangers of the country if the present measures
were pursued,—he became a temperate but firm opposer
of the Ministry which lost America.</p>

<p>In the year 1782, the Duke of Grafton accepted the
Office of Privy Seal under the Administration of Lord
Rockingham, and retained his situation after the death of
that truly patriotic nobleman and the resignation of Mr.
Fox. Upon the accession of the Coalition Ministry in
1783, he resigned his office, and never afterwards resumed
his seat in the Cabinet.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a></p>

the Maréchal, “N’est ce pas Madame de Maintenon qui passe?”—a

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> I once said this very thing to her. I was sitting by her at
her own house at some distance from the rest of the company,
and we were talking of the stand making against Madame du
Barry. The Duchesse de Choiseul asked me if that opposition
of the nobility to the King’s pleasure would not be reckoned
greatly to their honour in England? I answered coldly, “Yes,
Madam.” “Come,” said she, “you are not in earnest; but I
insist on you telling me seriously what you think.” I replied,
“Madam, if you command me, and will promise not to be
angry, I will tell you fairly my opinion.” She promised she
would. “Then,” said I, “I think this is all very well for
Mesdames de Beauvau and de Grammont; but <em>you</em>, Madam, had
no occasion to be so scrupulous.” She understood the compliment,
and was pleased—and I knew she would not dislike it, as it was
no secret to me that she was violently jealous of and hated her
sister-in-law; and I knew, too, that her warmth against Madame
du Barry was put on, that Madame de Grammont might not
appear to have more zeal against the Duc de Choiseul’s enemy
than she had. When she advised her husband to resign, she was
more sincere. Her warmest wish was to live retired with her
husband, on whom she doted; and she perhaps thought the
Duchesse de Grammont did not love her brother enough to quit
the world for him. She herself was once on the point of retiring
into a convent from the disgusts the Duchesse de Grammont continually
gave her. The Duke always sat between his wife and
sister at dinner, and sometimes kissed the latter’s hand. Madame
de Choiseul was timid, modest, and bashful, and had a little hesitation
in her speech. Madame de Grammont took pleasure in
putting her out of countenance. When the Duke was banished,
his wife and sister affected to be reconciled, that their hatred
might not disturb his tranquillity. Madame de Choiseul was pretty,
and remarkably well made, but excessively little, and too grave
for so spirituous a man. Madame de Grammont, with a fine
complexion, was coarsely made, had a rough voice, and an overbearing
manner, but could be infinitely agreeable when she
pleased. Madame de Choiseul was universally beloved and respected,
but neglected; Madame de Grammont was hated by
most, liked by many, feared and courted by all, as long as her
brother was in power. Her own parts, and the great party that
was attached to the Duke, even after his fall, secured much court
to the Duchesse de Grammont. The Duke esteemed his wife,
but was tired of her virtues and gravity. His volatile gallantry
did not confine itself to either.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> It is due to the satisfaction of the reader that I should give an
account how a stranger could become so well acquainted with the
secret history of the Court of France. I have mentioned my intimacy
with the Prince and Princesse de Craon. It was in the years
1740 and 1741, when the Prince was head of the Council there, and
my father was Prime Minister of England, I resided thirteen
months at Florence, in the house of Sir Horace Mann, our resident
and my own cousin—passed almost every evening at the Princesse’s,
and being about two years older than their son the Prince de Beauvau,
contracted a friendship with him, and was with the whole family
at Rome when the Prince went thither to receive the toison
d’or from the Prince of Santa Croce, the Emperor’s Ambassador.
That connection with her family soon made me as intimate with
Madame de Mirepoix on her arrival in England, which my frequent
journeys to Paris kept up. Madame de Monconseil had
been in correspondence with my father; I was acquainted with
her in 1739, and renewed my visits in 1765, and often since.
Her house was the rendezvous of the Duc de Choiseul’s enemies,
and I have supped there with Maréchal Richelieu and Madame de
Mirepoix. The Dowager Duchesse d’Aiguillon was an intimate
friend of my friend Lady Hervey, and was remarkably good to
me. In England I was as intimate with the Comte and Comtesse
du Châtelet, the bosom friends of the Duc de Choiseul, and was
regularly of their private suppers twice a-week, just at the beginning
of Madame du Barry’s reign; and as they knew how well I
was at the Hôtel de Choiseul, and consequently better acquainted
than almost any man in England with what was passing, it was
an entertainment to them to talk to me on those affairs; at the
same time that I had had the prudence never to take any part
which would not become a stranger, and was thus well received
by both parties. The Maréchal Richelieu was an old lover of the
Dowager Duchesse d’Aiguillon, and constantly at her house; and
yet she acted a handsome and neutral part; and it was at last
that with great difficulty her son could make her go to Madame
du Barry. But the great source of my intelligence was the
celebrated old blind Marquise du Deffand, who had a strong and
lasting friendship for me. As she hated politics, she entered into
none, but being the intimate friend of the Duchesse de Choiseul,
who called her “granddaughter” (Madame du Deffand having had
a grandmother Duchesse de Choiseul), of the Prince of Beauvau
and of Madame de Mirepoix, I saw them all by turns at their
house, heard their intrigues, and from her: and on two of my
journeys I generally supped five nights in a week with her at the
Duchesse de Choiseul’s, whither the Duke often came—and in
those, and in the private parties at Madame du Deffand’s I heard
such extraordinary conversations as I should not have heard if I
had not been so very circumspect, as they all knew. I shall
mention some instances hereafter. Here are two. Madame
de Mirepoix soon grew not content with Madame du Barry.
I was one evening very late on the Boulevard with Mesdames du
Mirepoix and Du Deffand. The latter asked the former, “<span class="lote" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Que
deviendroit Madame du Barry, si le Roi venoit à mourir?</span>” “<span class="lote" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Que
deviendroit elle?</span>” replied she, with the utmost scorn; “<span class="lote" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">elle iroit
à la Salpetrière, et elle est très faite pour y aller.</span>” On the
death of Louis the Fifteenth Madame de Mirepoix was disgraced;
on which her brother, the Prince de Beauvau, in compassion,
was reconciled to her, and she and the Princess pretended
to be reconciled, and always kissed when they met. I saw them
and their niece, the Viscomtesse de Cambis, act three of Molière’s
plays two nights together, to divert Madame du Deffand, who was
ill. This was in 1775. Yet when I went to take leave of
Madame de Mirepoix, she opened her heart to me, and showed
me how heartily she still hated her sister-in-law.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_35" href="#FNanchor_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> It appears from Lord Camden’s MS. letters to the Duke of
Grafton, that he had in the first instance underrated the importance
of Wilkes’s case. He next entered heartily into the general
indignation which Wilkes had excited. On the 3rd of April he
writes, “If the precedents and the constitution warrant an expulsion,
that perhaps may be right. A criminal flying his country to
escape justice—a convict and an outlaw—that such a person
should in open daylight throw himself upon the county as a candidate,
his crime unexpiated, is audacious beyond description.”
Still, he believes that the public excitement on the subject will
soon subside.
</p>
<p>
The proceedings in the Court of King’s Bench, when Wilkes’s
counsel gave notice of a motion for a reversal of the outlawry and
an arrest of judgment, made a deep impression on Lord Camden.
His feelings had by this time cooled, and he viewed the case as a
lawyer. He communicated his change of opinion to the Duke
in a letter of the 20th of April, and although the communication
was confidential, the bent of his mind seems to have been pretty
well understood by his colleagues. As the difficulties increased
he took the matter more to heart, and on the 9th of January
1769 he writes again to the Duke, expressing great uneasiness,
and announcing distinctly his opposition to the view taken by the
Cabinet of Wilkes’s case. He pronounces it “a hydra multiplying
by resistance, and gathering strength by every attempt to
subdue it.” “As the times are,” he says, “I had rather pardon
Wilkes than punish him. This is a political opinion independent
of the merits of the case.” These representations were fruitless.
The Duke had taken his part, was committed to the King and
the Cabinet, and, besides being of a hot temper, had become
so exasperated by Wilkes’s conduct as to consider his honour
would suffer from making the slightest concession to such a man.
Unhappily this difference of opinion materially affected the intercourse
of the Duke with Lord Camden. The former admits and
laments in his Memoirs that they seldom met during the summer
of 1769. The Duke’s marriage and frequent absence from
London kept them still more apart, and in the autumn it is obvious
from the tone of Lord Camden’s letters that he felt the separation
to be inevitable.—E.</p></div>

Little of the spirit of his ancestors seems to have descended to
him. He was a Lord of the Bedchamber in two reigns, and led an
easy luxurious life, being hardly known, except as the husband of
one of the most beautiful women of the day. He died in 1809,

Hardwicke, make an account public, in which the King’s unjustifiable
behaviour should be exposed. I concluded from his agitation
that they wanted to disculpate Lord Hardwicke and Lord
Rockingham of having given occasion to Mr. Yorke’s despair.
They found it prudent, however, to say no more on the subject.
An astonishing and indecent circumstance that followed not very
long after that tragedy was, that Lord Hardwicke, whose reproaches
had occasioned his brother’s death, attached himself to
the Court, against Lord Rockingham, and obtained bishopricks
for another of his brothers!</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_46" href="#FNanchor_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> The continuance of the Duke’s intimacy with Bradshaw

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_47" href="#FNanchor_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> The Duke probably had no direct connection with Lord Bute,
but had every reason to believe that the latter still enjoyed the
King’s confidence—at least, through his tools, Jenkinson, Dyson,
&amp;c.; and he had no reason to doubt, and yet submitted to, that
secret influence. Bradshaw was certainly the Earl’s creature,
though the Duke did not then know it; but it is not probable
that a pension to Dyson would have been added to the Duke’s last
disposition, had Dyson not been admitted to his Grace’s confidence.
Of Dyson’s attachment to Lord Bute the Duke was
assured by Dyson’s being saved by the King when the Duke and
Lord Rockingham came into Administration together.—(See

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_48" href="#FNanchor_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> The Duke of Grafton’s motives for resigning were no doubt
of a mixed character. His own statement of them will be found
in the Appendix. It is easy to believe that he had for some time
been anxious to be released from a position which could not be
otherwise than most painful to a man of honour. The business
of the Government, always onerous to a chief not used to much
application, nor having served any apprenticeship in subordinate
offices, was made particularly irksome to him by his being left
without a single colleague in the great departments of the State
whom he could call his friend. On the leading questions of public
policy, he often found himself in a minority. His proposition
for the immediate repeal of all the American import duties was
rejected by the casting vote of Lord Rochford, whom he had
himself recently introduced into the Cabinet. Lord North and
the Bedford party, by superior attention to the details of business,
had also drawn the management of affairs into their hands; and,
at the same time, ingratiated themselves with the King, so that
the Duke received no support from his Majesty against them,
and was subjected to mortifications, which must have been most
trying to his irritable temper. It was only after much persuasion
that he could be induced to accept the Treasury; he regarded his
acceptance as a concession to his political friends and to the King;
and, finding himself now virtually deserted by both, it is not surprising
that he should seek to divest himself of a character which
had ceased to be even respectable. No doubt he committed a
serious blunder in withholding from the public the real grounds
of his resignation. It has, irreparably, damaged his name with
posterity. He was by no means the insignificant or worthless
personage that he appears in the pages of Walpole and of Junius.
That he had talents is proved by the single fact of his being able
during, at least, one session to resist the whole force of the Opposition
in the Lords with no assistance, except from Lord Camden.
There is a letter from Mr. Fox among the Grafton MSS. saying,
that there is no public man whom he should prefer as a Leader.
The spirit with which he entered the lists with Lord Chatham
betrayed no want of courage. His political principles were those
of the Revolution; and where he departed from them, it was
from an error of judgment rather than of intention. A genuine
love of peace, and hatred of oppression, either civil or religious,
marked the whole of his public life; and, great as were the errors
which Walpole and Junius have justly denounced in his private
conduct, it is only just to state that, from the date of these
memoirs to his death, which comprises a period of near forty
years, there were few individuals more highly and generally
esteemed.—E.</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_50" href="#FNanchor_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> The following is the King’s note to Lord North on the following

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_52" href="#FNanchor_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> When the Government was formed, Sir Gilbert Elliot had

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_53" href="#FNanchor_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> Lord North was so careless of answering letters, that he made
enemies of the Dukes of Marlborough and Bridgewater by that
neglect. His behaviour to the Duke of Gloucester amounted to
brutality and want of feeling. In the subsequent breach between
the King and his Royal Highness, the latter wrote a letter
to his Majesty, begging a provision for his wife and children, and
sent the letter by Lord North. The latter received the King’s
answer on Friday night, but choosing to go the next morning to
Bushy Park for two days for his amusement, though he could not
but be sensible of the Duke’s anxiety at such a moment, and
which would be increased by knowing the answer was given,
Lord North only sent the Duke word on the Friday night that
he had got the King’s answer, and would bring it to his Royal
Highness on the following Monday. There was mean insolence,
too, in the disrespect, as the Duke could not but feel that Lord
North would not have treated him so rudely if his Royal Highness
had not been in disgrace.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_54" href="#FNanchor_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> At one of the Councils held to consider what steps should be
taken against Wilkes, when the Duke of Grafton was Minister
and Lord North Chancellor of the Exchequer, and some were for
violence and some for moderation, Lord North said not a word.
At last Lord Camden, Lord Chancellor, asked him why he did not
give his opinion? Lord North answered that he had been waiting
for their Lordships’ determination, being perfectly indifferent
what resolution they should take, as he was ready to adopt whatever
plan they should fix on. Lord Camden was so shocked at
that profligacy that he left the room. This account I received
from Lord Camden.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_55" href="#FNanchor_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> On the death of Lord Holderness, Warden of the Cinque
Ports, in 1778, the Duke of Dorset expected to succeed, having
applied to Lord North previously for his interest, who gave the
Duke his word he would not be his competitor; yet the post was
conferred on Lord North himself. The Duke asked an audience
of the King, and complained of this breach of promise. The
King said Lord North had not broken any promise, for the place
had been given to him without his asking it. A man of scrupulous
honour would not have been contented with that evasion
even if he had said, “I will not <em>ask</em> for the place.” He must have
known that the Duke could understand nothing but that he would
not be the person to intercept the office. A refusal of his interest
would have been honest; to have asked for the place, notwithstanding
he had promised he would not, would have been a
brave defiance of honesty; to take it after that promise was dirty,
and unwise, too, for he offended the Duke more by that evasion
than he would have done by refusing to assist him in obtaining
the post. No Minister is bound to promise all that is asked, but
every Minister is obliged to act like a gentleman, and not like an
attorney or a Jesuit. [It is probable that Lord North had reason
to believe that his refusal of the Wardenship of the Cinque Ports
would not be the means of securing that office for the Duke of
Dorset. It is certain that no Minister ever held his high post
with a personal character more unblemished. In the letters occasionally
cited in these notes, the King often contrasts Lord
North’s disinterestedness with the very different conduct which
his Majesty had witnessed in some of his other servants. Lord
North was far from wealthy,—a circumstance which the King had
discovered, and hence his Majesty earnestly sought an opportunity
of making a permanent provision for him.—E.]</p></div>

had resigned. Lord North made me the offer of the Treasurership
of the Navy; said the King wished I might accept, as many
persons were doubtful. Though hazardous, I did accept on
the spot.” The mode in which the offer is made and accepted,
raises a presumption against the existence of the intimate
confidence which the King was believed by Walpole to
place in Sir Gilbert Elliot.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_61" href="#FNanchor_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> A brief report of this interesting debate is given in Sir Gilbert
Elliot’s MS. Journal. “The Duke of Grafton, who spoke
with great gravity and weight, said, as he had before declared,
that it had been less likely to occur to <em>him</em> to apply to
the Chancellor; persuaded he was right, he was not solicitous
about more advice; but did it become a friend with the Great
Seal in his hand to suffer a friend, he all the while silent, to
involve the Administration in what he deemed an illegal act?”
On Lord Chatham saying that the Chancellor had early told
him his opinion, Lord Weymouth expressed astonishment that
the Chancellor should communicate to a private man at Hayes
what he had concealed from the Cabinet. The Chancellor was
certainly to blame in not earlier resigning his office, since he
was determined to go into opposition the moment Lord Chatham
appeared; but his health making that event doubtful, possibly led
the Chancellor into a conduct generally censured, and which had
greatly obstructed the affairs of Government.”—(See also Lord
Brougham’s remarks on this transaction in “Statesmen of the
Time of George the Third,” vol. iii. p. 171.)—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_62" href="#FNanchor_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> The enormous increase of the national debt having occasioned
a prodigious number of new taxes, the augmentation of officers to
levy those duties, had been a very principal cause of extending
the influence of the Crown, by the vast number of votes it necessarily
commanded in all the great commercial towns and ports.
Such a bill as this here mentioned was warmly contended for in
1781, and actually was obtained in 1782 on the change of the
Administration.</p></div>

from no good will to Sir James Lowther that Mr. Robinson
received this appointment, for Sir James’s name seldom occurs
in the King’s letters to Lord North without some harsh or condemnatory
expression; besides, the King says of him, even in
1779, “he is scarce worth gaining.” Mr. Robinson was long in
the King’s confidence, and employed in the most secret affairs.
He represented Harwich for many years, and realized a considerable
fortune in office. His only daughter married Lord Abergavenny.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_66" href="#FNanchor_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> The confidence placed by Lord North in Sir Gilbert Elliot

Lord North’s and Mr. Grenville’s speeches are able, particularly
the latter, which contains some interesting facts explanatory and
exculpatory of the passing of the Stamp Act. A fair, sensible,
and impressive description of the state of public opinion in the
North American Colonies was given by the Hon. Colonel Mackay
(brother of Lord Reay), who had lately been serving there
with his regiment. General Conway proposed to raise a colonial
revenue, by a requisition to the provinces from the Crown—a plan
which met with no support from any party. It is evident from
the admissions made by the Ministers that they felt the impolicy
of retaining the tea duty. Their difficulty was, how to abandon it
without risking their own honour, or what they perhaps valued
more, the King’s favour. Dr. Franklin, in a letter written a
fortnight after the debate, expresses a confident opinion that it
would have been repealed but for the impression made on the
House by Lord North’s reading the letters to which Walpole
refers.—E.</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_73" href="#FNanchor_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> It is impossible not to call the attention of the reader to the
conduct of that profligate man, Wedderburne. Sprung from a Jacobite
family (his uncle having been executed for the last rebellion),
he had set out a courtly advocate, but being laid aside on the change
of times, he had plunged into all the intemperance of opposition,
and now appeared a warm partisan of liberty, and an accuser of
his own immediate patrons. His mischievous abilities soon forced
him again into employment, which as naturally led him back to
his old monarchic principles, to support which, he, so lately a
champion of the constitution, was made Attorney-General, and at
length Chief Justice of the Common Pleas.
</p>
<p>
George Grenville was the very counterpart of Wedderburne.
He was not only educated a Whig, but had leaned to republicanism.
Becoming Prime Minister, no man had shown himself
more despotic. When overturned by his own violence, he reverted
to opposition; but having consummate pride and obstinacy,
and none of the flexibility of Wedderburne, but so far more
honesty, he wavered between faction and haughtiness, baffled his
own purposes by half measures, and could no more accommodate
his inflexible temper to the necessary means of regaining his
power, than he had been able to bend it to those that were requisite
for maintaining it.</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_74" href="#FNanchor_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> Colonel Clavering subsequently reaped more substantial fruits
of royal favour. He was soon raised to the rank of Lieutenant-General,
and made a Knight of the Bath, and Commander-in-chief
in Bengal. He died in Calcutta in 1777. The King, in
a private letter to Lord North, notices his death with great
feeling.—Sir Thomas Clavering voted generally with the Opposition.
The King regarded his interference as a favour to himself
personally, and was very desirous that Lord North should
let him know that his conduct was appreciated.—(Sir Gilbert

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_75" href="#FNanchor_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> The Ministry showed great indecision in the affair of the
remonstrance. Vigorous efforts, indeed, had been made to defeat
it in the City; and when these failed, the most serious perplexity
followed. The Attorney-General’s opinion was asked
whether the remonstrance was impeachable, but no answer could
be obtained from him.—(Sir Gilbert Elliot’s MS. Journal.—Mr.
Calcraft’s letter in Chatham Correspondence, vol. iii. p. 430.)
Frequent communications passed between the King and Lord
North on the subject. I shall only extract the following:—“I
shall be glad to hear what precedents you have got. I continue
of opinion that an answer must be given to the remonstrance,
and that, unless the instances are very similar of having directed a
certain number to attend, it would in every way be best to receive
them on the throne.”—(The King’s Letter to Lord North, MS.,

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_80" href="#FNanchor_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> The debate is reported in Cavendish, vol. i. p. 505. The
argument was all on one side, little being urged against the bill deserving
of serious refutation. The measure had the good fortune
to receive very general approbation out of the House, and by
many it was regarded as giving its author an incontestable claim
to the gratitude of his country. How far all this commendation
was genuine, is another question. It has of later days been
doubted whether the Grenville Act has not been productive of
more harm than good. It certainly increased the number of petitions,
without diminishing the expense of prosecuting them, and any
improvement it may have effected in the tribunal for trying them
was very short lived. As long as political parties were split into
several sections, the election committees preserved a decent impartiality;
but from the time that only two great parties were recognised
in the State, all the evils revived which it had been the
object of the Act to extirpate. Such gross injustice was committed
as at length to rouse public indignation, and after much
discussion in the House the Committees were again essentially
reformed by a recent Act. This measure was framed with care
and good intentions; but some of the decisions to which it has
given rise are too startling for it to be yet recognised as a successful
piece of legislation.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_81" href="#FNanchor_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> Barré might have added, that Grenville had fallen because
he was not influenced by Lord Bute, but had been at enmity with
him, and turned out his brother Mackenzie; and that Dowdeswell
had fallen from the same cause, when he was Chancellor of the
Exchequer under Lord Rockingham, who was also an enemy to
Lord Bute. Fourteen years after the period here treated, viz., in
1783–4, <em>the secret influence</em> was no longer secret; the Duke of
Portland’s Administration was openly overturned by the exertion
of that influence, and, which is still more remarkable, the eldest
son of the very Mr. Grenville here mentioned was the tool employed
by Jenkinson (here also in question) and the secret cabal of
the King. Be it remembered, too, that Mr. Grenville’s bill which
for thirteen years had been carried into constant execution with
strict justice and applause, was impeached in the first instance of
the new Parliament of 1784, chosen in consequence of that secret
influence, and upon occasion of the scrutiny for the Westminster
election, which violation was practised by Mr. William Pitt, the
second son of Lord Chatham, in which he was supported by Mr.
William Grenville, the second son of Mr. George Grenville,
author of the bill.</p></div>

price 2<i>s.</i>
</p>

<p class="p1 b1 center">“Assume a virtue if you have it not.”</p>

<p>
This tract has long since sunk into oblivion; no copy of it is
to be found even in the British Museum, and I have searched for
it in vain in other large repositories of ephemeral literature. As
far as can be inferred from the extracts and criticism in contemporary
periodicals, Mrs. Macaulay’s great panacea for the removal
of all national grievances consisted of short Parliaments, with the
additional security of members being made incapable of re-election
under a certain number of years. This arrangement the
writer predicted would do away with the evils generally considered
to attach to frequent elections, “so that the violent contentions
for seats in Parliament, both on the side of Government
and of individuals, would sink into the quiet coolness of nominations
for parish officers.”—She overlooked the effect of such a
system on the character of the House, and the experience of
France seems to prove that it would lead to the election of few
persons above the calibre of parish officers.
</p>
<p>
The style and spirit of the work seem to be fairly represented
in the following extract:—“The wicked system of policy
set on foot by the leaders of the revolutionists in the reign of
King William, and which proceeded perhaps more from fear of
personal safety than from any very material intent against their
country, was thoroughly completed under the Administration of
their sons. But whilst this State faction, who called themselves
Whigs, but who in reality were as much the destructive, though
concealed, enemies of public liberty as were its more generous
because more avowed adversaries, the Tories, whilst they were
erecting their batteries against those they termed inveterate
Jacobites and prejudiced republicans, it never came into their
heads that they were ruining their own importance, and consequently
rendering the Crown strong enough to set all parties
at defiance, to put them on their good behaviour, and to treat
them with that contempt which is natural to a Sovereign in the
plenitude of independent power.”—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_89" href="#FNanchor_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> Lord North, like other Prime Ministers, never attended
committees of elections. Mackenzie being pushed on a Scotch
election which he favoured, sent for Lord North late in the evening
(at this very time) to vote, though he had not heard the
cause—and yet they were beaten.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_91" href="#FNanchor_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> Mrs. Anne Pitt, Lady Bute’s friend, offered Lord Villiers, her
relation and son of the Countess of Grandison, that the Princess
of Wales should procure for him an English Peerage, if he would
marry one of Lord Bute’s daughters. This was in June 1771.
I had it from Lord Villiers himself, who married a daughter of
Lord Hertford, my first cousin. I have changed my opinion, I
confess, various times on the subject of Lord Bute’s favour with
the King; but this I take to have been the truth. From the
death of her husband the Princess Dowager had the sole influence
over her son, and introduced Lord Bute into his confidence;
but I believe that even before his accession the King was weary
both of his mother and of her favourite, and wanted to, and did
early shake off much of that influence. After Lord Bute’s resignation,
his credit declined still more, and Lord Bute certainly grew
disgusted, though he still retained authority enough over the King
to be consulted, or to force himself into a share of the counsels
that changed so many Ministries till after Lord Chatham’s last
Administration. Lord Bute’s pride was offended at the wane of
his power; and on his last return from abroad, the King complained
to the Duke of Gloucester that <em>the fellow</em> (that was the
term) had not once paid his duty to him. I have doubted whether
that coolness was not affected; yet it was carrying dissimulation
far indeed, and unnecessarily, if acted to his favourite brother,
then living in the palace with him, in his confidence, not hostile
to Bute, nor then likely to report the communication. Such
solemn declarations had indeed been made both by the King and
Bute that they never saw each other in private, that those visits
could not be frequent, and the King no doubt was glad of that
pretext for avoiding an irksome dictator. Afterwards, the engrossing
ambition of Bute’s son, Lord Mount Stewart, was hurt
at the proscription of his father; and whenever his own suits were
denied he broke out publicly, and frequently quarrelled with Lord
North, who would not have thwarted his views had the King countenanced
them; yet as Lord Mount Stewart generally carried his
points at last, it is probable that Bute had been trusted too
deeply to make it safe totally to break with him. However, his
credit was so small that, towards the end of the American war,
Mackenzie, through whom the intercourse was chiefly carried
on, retired to Scotland, and for some time came rarely to London.
But in the year 1783 Bute again saw the King often,
though very privately; and though Lord Mount Stewart warmly
and loudly espoused the party of Charles Fox, Mackenzie adhered
to the King; and Lord Bute owned that though he thought
Mr. Fox the only man who could save this country, he loved the
King so much that he could not resist his Majesty’s entreaties to
support him.
</p>
<p>
If I have accounted rightly for so great a mystery as whether
Lord Bute had an ascendant or not from the time of his ceasing
to be openly Prime Minister, I might be asked, Who then had
real influence with the King, for his subsequent Ministers indubitably
had not?—I should answer readily, Jenkinson. He was
the sole confidant of the King; and having been the creature of
Bute, might choose prudentially not to incense his old patrons
but to keep him in play enough to divert the public eye from
himself; and thence, I conclude, mediated now and then for
favours for Lord Bute’s friends, and despised his intellects too
much to apprehend his recovery of credit. Lord Mansfield no
doubt frequently, when his timidity would suffer him, was consulted
and gave advice, and especially was deep in the plan of the
American war; and though the King’s views and plans were
commonly as pestilent to his own interest as to his people, yet as
they were often artfully conducted, he and Bute were too ignorant
and too incapable to have digested the measures; and therefore,
as nobody else enjoyed the royal confidence, there can be no doubt
but Jenkinson was the director or agent of all his Majesty’s
secret counsels. Jenkinson was able, shrewd, timid, cautious, and
dark; and much fitter to suggest and digest measures than to
execute them. His appearance was abject; his countenance betrayed
a consciousness of secret guile; and though his ambition
and rapacity were insatiate, his demeanour exhibited such a want
of spirit, that had he stood forth as Prime Minister, which he
really was, his very look would have encouraged opposition; for
who can revere authority which seems to confess itself improperly
placed, and ashamed of its own awkwardly assumed importance!</p></div>

Diary of Lord Melcombe, published in 1784. Lord Melcombe
seems to have been ignorant of great part of the affair of Fawcett,
and to have received little information on it but from the Princess
or those most concerned to suppress the truth. Indeed his Diary
is often obscure, and, as being written only with a view to himself,
he seldom details or explains either debates or events, if he
had nothing to do in them, or did not attend their commencement
or conclusion in the House of Commons. Yet as far as it goes
his Diary is most uncommonly authentic; and as it is so very
disgraceful to himself we cannot doubt but he believed what he
wrote to be true. Where he and I write on the same passages
we shall be found to agree, though we never had any connection,
were of very different principles, and received our information

grounds which do not come under the denomination of “leading

and take it to be clearly settled, that evidence of a public sale,
or public exposing to sale in the shop by the servant, or anybody
in the house or shop, though there was no privity or concurrence
in the master, is sufficient evidence to convict him, unless he
proves the contrary, or that there was some trick or collusion.”—(“Trial
of John Almon,” 8vo., London, 1770.)—The motion for
the new trial was made on the 27th of June following, on the ground
that the master was not liable for the acts of his servant in
<em>a criminal case</em>, where his privity was not proved. The motion
was refused. The Court then expressed an unanimous opinion
that the pamphlet being bought in the shop of a common known
bookseller, purporting on its title-page to be printed for him, is a
sufficient <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">primâ facie</i> evidence of its being published by him, <em>not
indeed conclusive, because he might have contradicted it, if the facts
would have borne it, by contrary evidence</em>.—(Burrows’s Reports,
vol. v. p. 2686.) This is not less liberal than the present proof
of publication recognised by the courts of law; and it is generally
understood that nothing short of proof of interference, if not
of absolute <em>prohibition</em> by the bookseller would now be received.
Abominable as the law of libel might be, it seems to have been
correctly laid down by Lord Mansfield. Fifty years earlier
Almon would have been pilloried, and probably whipped. In 1759,
Mr. Beardmore, the Under Sheriff, was fined fifty shillings, and
imprisoned two months, for pillorying Dr. Shebbeare moderately.

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_111" href="#FNanchor_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> The King no doubt regarded his promise to a young courtier
absolved by the latter becoming a politician, and entering into
active opposition. It is extraordinary, too, that the Duke should
not have been acquainted with the promise made to Conway.
That promise the King certainly kept in the most honourable
manner. In a letter to Lord North of the 1st of October, his
Majesty says, “You will hear of applications for the royal regiment
of Horse Guards on the death of Lord Granby. I therefore
tell you that General Conway, when Secretary, and on his
resignation, had a promise of them. I therefore shall immediately
send to Lord Barrington to make out the notification.”—(King’s
MS. Letters to Lord North.)—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_112" href="#FNanchor_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> Lord Mansfield had recommended the King to take this
course, which his Majesty declined to do, on the ground that it
would be construed both by the Courts of Madrid and Versailles
as indicative of a resolution to accommodate the dispute at all
events.—(King’s Letter to Lord North, 9th November.)—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_114" href="#FNanchor_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> He was feared by all the leading men in the House, even by
Mr. Pitt, who frankly told the King, during the negotiations in
1765, which ended in the admission of the Rockingham party into
office, that, without Mr. Grenville, he saw nothing in the Treasury
either solid or substantial; (see also <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">supra</i>, vol. ii. p. 191).
His knowledge, in revenue matters particularly, made him most
formidable in Opposition; (Sir Gilbert Elliot’s MS. Journal.)
Mr. Fox did not entertain an equally high opinion of him, and
used, indeed, to speak slightingly, both of his knowledge and
abilities; but Mr. Fox was a very young man when he knew Mr.
Grenville, and they were not only, in all respects, very unlike,
but the general turn of Mr. Fox’s mind would make him view
Mr. Grenville’s defects in an exaggerated light, and many circumstances,
not the least being the disagreement between Lord
Holland and Mr. Grenville, combined to place them on far from
a friendly footing.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_115" href="#FNanchor_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> Walpole’s suspicions of Lord Barrington’s motives are probably
correct. The King (as the editor has reason to believe) always
felt great unwillingness to trust the command of the army to any
officer taking a prominent part in politics. His notion was that
the army ought to be entirely in the hands of the Crown. This
must have been the ground of his objection to the appointment
of Conway. Lord Barrington’s declaration was certainly
most injudicious, but it was provoked, not so much by his zeal
to please the King, as by the taunts of Colonel Barré. The
debate is reported by Cavendish, vol. ii. p. 37. The Government
seem to have had the best of the argument.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_118" href="#FNanchor_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> Lord Hillsborough was described by Walpole, some years before,
as “a young man of great honour and merit, remarkably
nice in weighing whatever cause he was to vote in, and excellent
at setting off his reasons, if the cause was at all tragic, by a
solemnity in his voice and manner that made much impression
on his hearers.”—(Memoirs of George the Second, vol. i. p. 70.)—With
such qualifications as a character for independence and
some proficiency in public speaking, he was able to render the
Ministers essential service, and, in return, they admitted him
into their counsels, where he was believed to exercise considerable
influence. Lord Holland courted him, and he was esteemed
by Mr. Pitt. At length, in 1763, he accepted the post
of First Lord of Trade and Plantations, and in 1768, as has
been already mentioned, became Secretary of State. He did not
maintain in office the reputation he had acquired out of it.
Although he made, at times, a tolerable set speech, he proved an
imprudent, and by no means effective debater. In the Cabinet
he attached himself to the Court party, and gave the most determined
opposition to the concessions to America, recommended
by the Duke of Grafton and Lord Camden, both of whom
charged him personally with exasperating the unhappy differences
between the two countries by the course he took with respect to
his circular letter of May, 1769. He was less to blame in the
debate on the Falkland Islands than Walpole supposes, for the
recent publication of Mr. Harris’s dispatches (Malmesbury Correspondence,
vol. i. p. 63) shows that he did not overrate the pacific
disposition of the Spanish Court. In Irish politics he always took
an active part, and was one of the first statesmen who sought to
promote the Union. Several useful institutions in Ireland owed
their origin or prosperity to his vigorous support. He also set a
valuable example to other Irish landlords, by his improvements
on his estates in Downshire. In 1772 he was made Earl
of Hillsborough, and in 1793 he obtained from Mr. Pitt an
Irish Marquisate (of Downshire). He died in 1793.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_119" href="#FNanchor_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> The report of this debate occupies more than thirty pages in
Cavendish, vol. ii. pp. 57–88. The speeches were of a discursive
character.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_120" href="#FNanchor_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> The debate is given by Cavendish, vol. ii. p. 89. It turned
more on the law of libel as administered in the recent trials of
Rex <i>v.</i> Almon than on the specific subject of the motion. The
speeches of Mr. Burke and Mr. Serjeant Glynn may still be
read with interest.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_121" href="#FNanchor_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> Lord Egmont united qualifications which seldom fail to
raise their fortunate possessor to the highest offices in a constitutional
government. He was excelled by few of his time
as a public speaker, by none as a political writer. His great
talent was said to lie in indefatigable application, and yet he
delighted in popular excitement, which he could direct with consummate
skill, and with courage that proved equal to any emergency.
The effect, however, of these gifts was marred by a
perversion of judgment which led him both into gross absurdities,
and the most culpable inconsistencies. When scarce a
man, Walpole says, he had a scheme of assembling the Jews and
making himself their King.—(Memoires of George the Second,
vol. i. p. 30.)—It is more certain that he regarded the restoration
of feudal tenures as the best security for the liberty and
welfare of the people! After having been the idol and the
leader of mobs, he became the obsequious follower of Lord Bute,
and, although a passionate admirer of fame, he sought no result
from his political exertions beyond places, titles, and sinecures.
His mansion in Somersetshire, a monument of his extraordinary
predilection for the middle ages, was pulled down only a few
years ago. Walpole has given his character in the Memoires
of George the Second, vol. ii. p. 32, which is illustrated by some
amusing anecdotes in a letter to Sir Horace Mann (Letters,
vol. ii. p. 260).—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_123" href="#FNanchor_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> This motion arose out of the debate on the power of the Attorney-General
to file informations <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex officio</i>. The able speeches
made by Serjeant Glynn and Burke forcibly exposed the injustice
of the law of libel, as administered by Lord Mansfield in the
recent trials, and supplied many of the arguments which were
afterwards so effectually used in procuring the alteration of the law
by Lord Camden and Mr. Fox (Cavendish vol. ii. p. 89, seqq.—E.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_124" href="#FNanchor_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> This is one of the few instances in which Serjeant Glynn
appears to disadvantage. No doubt he felt strongly the wrongs
of the Colonists, and shared with Lord Chatham and other
leading statesmen of the day, a most unfavorable opinion of the
Parliament. No personal considerations influenced him. He
was as little tainted by the political as by the moral profligacy
of Wilkes. Few of his speeches in Parliament have been preserved,
but all are in an elevated tone, and the candour and
moderation which distinguish them are not less remarkable
than their talent and intrepidity. In these, as in many
other respects, he bore a strong resemblance to Sir Samuel
Romilly. It is to be regretted that few particulars can now be
collected of this valuable man. He belonged to a Cornish
family, once settled at a seat of the same name, now the property
of Lord Vivian. His practice at the bar was very considerable.
Not only did he argue most of the political cases of
the day, but it appears, from Mr. Wilson’s and the other contemporary
reports, that he had a large share of the general business.
He succeeded Mr. Eyre as Recorder of London in 1772, when
the salary of the office was raised from 800<i>l.</i> to 1000<i>l.</i> a-year,
as a mark of respect towards him. He died in middle life, on
the 16th September, 1779.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_125" href="#FNanchor_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> This confession is very memorable. The subsequent behaviour
of the Court leaves strong room to suspect that instead of
profiting of the favourable disposition of the Colonies by temperate
measures, the Court hurried into the succeeding war, and
wished to provoke the Colonies to unite, that all might be treated
as rebels and conquered. The Ministers did succeed in the provocation,
but not in the conquest.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_129" href="#FNanchor_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> I suspect that Lord Rockingham, whose aunt Lord Mansfield
had married, and to whom Lord Mansfield always paid court,
meant to save him, though through this whole reign Lord Mansfield
had constantly laboured to sap that great palladium of our
liberties, juries. As the House of Lords would probably have
protected Lord Mansfield, perhaps his panic was a curb to him;
whereas an exculpation might have encouraged him. Still the
trimming conduct of Lord Rockingham, and Lord Camden, and
Lord Chatham was inexcusable.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_130" href="#FNanchor_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> Lord Camden, with more apparent firmness than Lord Mansfield,
was neither a brave nor a steady man; though having taken
the better side, the defence of the Constitution, he was not reduced
to the artifices and terrors of the Chief Justice. It was but
rarely that Lord Camden took a warm and active part, but often
absented himself from the House when he should have stood
forth. He told me himself that he forbore attending private
causes in the House lest he should hurt the side he supported by
Lord Mansfield’s carrying the majority against the party defended
by Lord Camden, merely from enmity to him. If this tenderness
was well founded, how iniquitous was his antagonist! I do believe
that though their hatred was reciprocal, Lord Camden feared
the abilities and superior knowledge of his antagonist; and as
Lord Camden was a proud man, he could not bear inferiority.
As even Lord Chatham did not retain the deference for him he
expected and deserved, their friendship declined almost to annihilation.
The Duke of Grafton and Lord Shelburne, though still
much more unjustifiably, slighted him too; and a series of those
neglects concurred to throw Lord Camden, towards the end of
his life, into a situation that did not raise his character, nor was
even agreeable to his opinion, for the moment before he joined
Mr. Pitt in 1784, he had declared his sentiments of Mr. Fox’s
predominant abilities.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_131" href="#FNanchor_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> This was the case of Tothill <i>v.</i> Pitt, of which the details are
given in Maddock’s Reports, vol. i. p. 488; Dicken’s Reports,
p. 431; Brown’s Parliamentary Cases, p. 453. It related to
the property of a Mr. Tothill, which had come to Sir William
Pynsent, as the legatee and executor of his daughter, to whom it
had been bequeathed by Mr. Tothill. The decision of the Lords
was right, and it restored the decree of Sir Thomas Sewell, the
Master of the Rolls, a lawyer whose authority stood much higher
than that of the Lord Commissioners.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_132" href="#FNanchor_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> The debate on Lord George Germaine’s motion is reported
in Cavendish, vol. ii. p. 160–172. One result of the quarrel
between the Houses was the exclusion of strangers from both,
during the remainder of the session. The public, therefore,
was kept in ignorance of all parliamentary proceedings that were
not made known by the members of either House.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_133" href="#FNanchor_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> Governor Johnstone’s subsequent actions were far from
setting his character in a better light. During half the American
war he voted in Parliament as condemning it, and in private paid
great court to the Duke of Richmond as a principal opponent;
not without the Duke’s being cautioned by his friends, who suspected
Johnstone for an allowed spy of the Court,—a jealousy
that seemed well founded, as Johnstone on a sudden was appointed
by the Minister one of the commissioners to treat for
peace with America. In that department he augmented the suspicion
of his double-dealing, but without adding any credit to his
judgment. Soon after he was entrusted, as Commodore, with five
ships, which he boasted should effect the most desperate service—but
effected nothing; and he terminated his naval campaign with
such flagrant tyranny and injustice to one of his captains, whom
he also despatched to the East Indies in hopes of his complaints,
that a court of law, on the poor gentleman’s return, gave him
damages to the amount of some thousand pounds; and Johnstone
appealing from the verdict, all he obtained was an increase
of his fine: however, on another appeal, the sentence was set
aside.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_134" href="#FNanchor_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> As these Memoirs will not be continued, it may be worth
while to give a short abstract of the rest of Lord George’s life.
Though in Opposition, he kept a door open for his return to
Court without his associates, by not joining them against the
American war. When that war grew more and more hopeless,
Lord George was offered to undertake that province, and most
injudiciously accepted it. This was the more surprising to <em>me</em>,
as, besides his having retrieved his character by the affair with
Johnstone, and acquired a large fortune from Lady Elizabeth Germaine,
with the additional favourable circumstance of changing his
name, whence his sons, if dropping that of Sackville, might avoid
great part of the disgrace that had fallen on their father, he himself
not three years before, in a conversation, in which he had
given me many instances of the King’s duplicity, had said to me,
“<em>Sir, whoever lives to see the end of this reign, will see one of the
most unfortunate that ever was in England!</em>” The position of the
American war certainly countenanced his prediction. Yet his
native ambition, or the vanity of supposing that he could give a
new turn to affairs, overpowered his judgment, and shut his eyes
on the torrent of abuse that would again be let loose against him—and
was. He did recommence his career with great spirit and
activity, but with no success at all; and it was only in his deportment
that he did show spirit. In Parliament he was browbeaten
by daily insults; and his former parts so entirely forsook him,
that younger men, who had not seen his outset, would not believe
what was attested to them of his precedent abilities. Disappointed
of the glory he had promised to himself, and quarrelling
with Lord Sandwich, the head of the Admiralty, who counteracted
or would not concur in his plans, Lord George relaxed, and
finding his associates inclined to sacrifice him as a scapegoat
(though they could not save their own places), he yielded to the
storm, and was so far fortunate, that being the first victim before
the general crash, he made terms for himself, and retired into the
House of Lords with a Viscount’s coronet; yet even that lucky
retreat could not be obtained without a new, and most cruel, and
unprecedented insult. The Marquis of Caermarthen objected to
his admission into the House of Lords on the old sentence of the
court martial. What heightened the flagrancy of that attack on
the foundation of so almost obsolete a stigma was, that Lord
Caermarthen had actually been in the King’s service with Lord
George while recently Secretary of State. Lord Caermarthen
made himself odious; and Lord George found at least that mankind
were not so abandoned as to enjoy such wanton malevolence.
</p>

<p>
Lord George, become Viscount Sackville, died in the autumn
of 1785, of a short illness, and in a manner that once more did
him honour. He spoke of the bitter scenes through which he
had passed, and with great firmness declared how resigned he
was to death. Of Prince Ferdinand he spoke with singular candour;
said his Highness had undone him from resentment; yet
was so great a man, that he not only forgave but admired him.
General Sloper, his enemy, he said, was a very black man; for
Lord Caermarthen, he was so weak, that he felt nothing for him
but contempt. It was remarkable that Lord Caermarthen, moderate
as his abilities were, disgustful as his assault on Lord Sackville
had been, and though disliked by the King, was by the last
collision of parties become at that very moment Secretary of State.
</p>
<p>
[A long note on the character of Lord George Sackville is also
given by Walpole in the Memoirs of George the Second (vol. ii.
p. 432). He evidently bore that nobleman no good will, and
falls in the course of his remarks into some inconsistencies, which,
as Lord Holland remarks, “it would be difficult to explain, if it
were any part of the duty of an editor to explain the contradictions
of an author.” A well-written and interesting, though partial,
account of Lord George is contained in the Memoirs of his
friend and secretary, Richard Cumberland. Many additional
and curious particulars have been collected by Mr. Coventry in
that ingenious work, “Critical Enquiry regarding the real Author
of Junius, proving them to have been written by Lord Viscount
Sackville.”—E.]</p></div>

the latter having the fate of Squillace before his eyes, would not
take it on himself, but advised his master to call the Castilians to
council. They, persuaded that a commercial nation, as England
was, would not make war for a rock, exhorted the King to maintain
his point of honour. D’Aranda, his favourite, agreed with the
Castilians; but though the King, who, from the time he was
King of Naples, and had been humbled into a neutrality by our
navy, hated this country, yet he was at that moment so much
influenced by Grimaldi, that he rose abruptly and broke up the
council. [The King, independently of Grimaldi, was personally

insults she had received, appeared fifteen years afterwards; for,
retiring into a convent on the Duke’s death, and Madame de
Grammont, who was a large woman, and probably grown more
corpulent, going to visit her, Madame de Choiseul excused herself
from seeing her, on pretence that the conventual stairs were so
narrow that Madame de Grammont would have difficulty to
ascend them.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_147" href="#FNanchor_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> Lord Sandwich has received similar praise, as an efficient
public servant, from Mr. Butler, a very acute and well-informed
writer, who lived on terms of intimacy with him, and was in
every respect qualified to form a just opinion of his merits.
“Lord Sandwich might serve as a model for a man of business.
He rose early, and till a late dinner dedicated his whole time to
business; he was very methodical; slow, not wearisome; cautious,
not suspicious; rather a man of sense than a man of talent;
he had much real good nature; his promises might be relied on.
His manners partook of the old Court, and he possessed in a singular
degree the art of attaching persons of every rank to him.
Few houses were more agreeable or instructive than his Lordship’s;
it was filled with rank, beauty, and talent, and every one
was at ease. He professed to be fond of music, and musicians
flocked to him; he was the soul of the Catch Club, and one of the
Directors of the Concert of Ancient Music, but (which is the case
with more than one noble, and more than one gentle amateur) he
had not the least real ear for music, and was equally insensible of
harmony and melody.”—(Butler’s Reminiscences, vol. i. p. 74.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_148" href="#FNanchor_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> The spirit shown by the Duke of Bedford during his last
illness is very remarkable; notwithstanding the languor and depression
attendant on the complaint under which he laboured, he
neglected no part of his business, either public or private. He
spoke several times in the Lords during the session of 1770; he
attended with his usual regularity the meetings of the various institutions
of which he was a member; he superintended the
management of his extensive estates, and yet all the while never
allowing himself to lose the amusements which he enjoyed whilst
in health. Some of the notices in his Journal are in this respect
very characteristic.

In the collection of papers at Woburn are some of his letters
written within a month of his death. One is an application to
Lord Barrington on behalf of a French officer whom he considered
it a point of honour to provide for. Neither the style nor tone is
that of a dying man; he says, “It seems next to impossible to
conceive that any fresh subterfuge can be found to avoid giving
Captain Gualy the reasonable request I have made in his favour,
especially considering the offer I have made to compensate to any
officer, out of my own pocket, that might be aggrieved by it, such
loss as he shall sustain by such promotion, more especially considering
that this gentleman is kinsman and namesake of Madame
de Choiseul, and a man of credit and character. Should it be so,
I wish to have it explicitly of your Lordship, that I may inform
that lady that I have entirely lost all credit at my own Court, and
that the King’s Ministers pay no regard to my solicitations,
though ever so just and reasonable, notwithstanding the services
I may venture to assert that I did my country in negotiating and
signing the last peace, &amp;c.” Whatever might have been the
Duke’s errors of judgment, he was a high-minded warm-hearted
man, of great energy of character and capacity for business.—E.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_149" href="#FNanchor_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> Mr. Justice Bathurst was the second son of Allen, the first
Lord Bathurst, “one of the most amiable, as he was one of the
most fortunate men of his age,” immortalized alike by the polished
poetry of Pope and the brilliant eloquence of Burke. He had
not much of his father’s gaiety and spirit. For some years he
had sat on the Bench of the Common Pleas, with a fair reputation,
and he had previously enjoyed a considerable practice at the
Bar. A very popular and useful work, Buller’s Nisi Prius, is
understood to have been compiled from his notes. In early life
he had made some figure in the House of Commons as Attorney-General
to the Prince, and Walpole notices him as a rising man
in the Opposition.—(Walpole’s Letters, vol. ii. p. 262.)—As a
Commissioner of the Great Seal he showed but moderate parts,
and his appointment as Chancellor excited much surprise. It
had been believed that the Seals would be offered to Mr. De
Grey, as they had been in the preceding year by the Duke of
Grafton; and that gentleman so perfectly expected it, that he
announced himself as Lord Chancellor at a dinner of his family.
On the very day following this announcement it was declared
that the choice had fallen on Mr. Bathurst. He is not to be
ranked among the great men who have filled this high office;
his decisions are seldom cited, and indeed few of them have been
preserved. It was perhaps a disadvantage to him to preside over
a bar of superior talents to himself, the leaders of which were
Thurlow and Wedderburne. A coolness that took place between
him and Lord North furnished the King, who never liked him,
with an excuse for transferring the Seals to Lord Thurlow, and
he became President of the Council. He died at an advanced age
in 1794.—E.</p></div>

Grimaldi, indeed, told Mr. Harris, on the latter acquainting
him with his recall, that “he was sure that the moment he
mentioned it to the King his Majesty would recall his Ambassador
from London, when, of course, no prospect would remain of
that accommodation being brought about which his Catholic
Majesty had so much at heart.”—(Mr. Harris to Lord Rochford,
13th of January, 1771.)—He also declined to recognise Mr.
Harris any longer as Minister, upon the pitiful plea of the
absence of his credentials. Probably he at the same time wrote
to Prince Masserano desiring him to expect an immediate recall.
Far from the King taking such a step, he manifested his satisfaction
at the arrangement in a more evident manner than Grimaldi
wished, and expressed great satisfaction at the gracious manner
in which Prince Masserano had been received at the British Court
after signing the declaration.—(Mr. Harris’s Letter, 14th February.—Malmesbury

within a certain time therein (viz., in the Act) limited.” An
able defence of Sir James Lowther was made by Lord North, and
a still more able defence of the Duke of Portland by Dunning.
The correctness of Walpole’s statement of the feelings of the
Court is illustrated by the following extract from a letter of the
King’s to Lord North: “11th February.—What has passed in
the House of Commons this day is a fresh proof that truth,
justice, and even honour are constantly to be given up when they
relate to Sir James Lowther.”—(MS.)—The King’s indignation,

from any partiality for Sir James Lowther.—E.</p></div>

prejudices of the day in a letter to Lord North of the 21st. He
says, “I have much considered this affair of the printers, and in
the strongest manner recommend that every caution should be used
to prevent its becoming a serious business. It is highly necessary
that this strange and lawless method of publishing debates
should be put a stop to. But is not the House of Lords the best
court to bring such miscreants before, as it can fine as well as
imprison, and has broader shoulders to support the odium of so
salutary a measure?”—(MS.)—It is easy to smile at the King’s
indignation, but the publication of the debates was not more
reasonable than the publication of the list of divisions, which
many warm friends of constitutional liberty, even in the present

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_160" href="#FNanchor_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> Sir George Colebrooke, Bart., an eminent merchant in the
City, chairman, and for a long time a most influential director of
the East India Company. He succeeded to the Baronetcy on the
death of his brother, Sir James, who left two daughters—the
Countess of Tankerville and Lady Aubrey. Sir George was a
Whig, but he made the interests of the Company his first object
in all his political connections, and in return he made his connection
with the Company contribute to his political importance,
which, at critical periods, when parties were nicely balanced, was
found to be not inconsiderable. He had been educated at Leyden,
and both wrote and spoke with spirit and ability. The failure
of some extensive speculations in which he had been involved by
a partner obliged his firm, in 1773, to suspend their payments, and
he retired for some years to the Continent; but eventually a satisfactory
arrangement was made with his creditors, and he passed the
latter years of his life in ease and independence. It was during this
period that he amused himself in composing his Memoirs, a work
that gives a curious picture of the political intrigues of the day.
He died in 1809, leaving two sons, both of whom attained high
office in India. The younger, Mr. Henry Colebrooke, was a
member of the Supreme Council in Bengal, a very eminent
Oriental scholar, and the author of some valuable works on
Hindoo law and literature. The present Baronet is his son.—E.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_163" href="#FNanchor_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> This case is given briefly in contemporary reports, under
the title of Smith and others <i>v.</i> Lord Pomfret and wife. It had
been originally heard before Lord Camden when he held the
Great Seal. He directed an action at law to be brought to try
the right in dispute. The verdict, as Walpole correctly states,
was given against Lord Pomfret. His Lordship then applied to
the Commissioners of the Great Seal, who had succeeded Lord
Camden, for a new trial, which they refused. On this he
appealed to the Lords, where a <em>new trial, and not the estate</em> in
question, was granted, upon some distinction taken by Lord
Mansfield as to the original order for the action having been
made without Lord Pomfret’s consent—a point which seems to
have escaped the counsel, who had argued the case on the merits,
which seem to have been on Lord Pomfret’s side, since the new
trial ended in a verdict in his favour. There are some points of
practice involved in the case which make it probable that the
decision of the Lords would not be followed in the present day,
and there is no doubt that the interference of the <em>lay</em> Lords in the
adjudication of rights of this nature was wholly unjustifiable.
No similar instance has occurred during the present century,—the
attendance of lay peers on appeals being regarded as a
mere matter of form. The decision on the appeal rests exclusively
with the <em>law</em> peers, otherwise the appeal would be from a
court of great authority to one of none at all.—E.</p></div>

Princess of Wales, and that she still retained some over her son,
came out by the indiscretion of Mrs. Anne Pitt, privy-purse to the
Princess, and intimate friend of Lady Bute. Endeavouring to
persuade her cousin, the young Lord Villiers, only son of the
Countess of Grandison, to marry a younger and homely daughter
of Lord Bute, she engaged that if he would, the Princess
Dowager would procure him an English peerage—he preferred

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_210" href="#FNanchor_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> I cannot help taking notice of a faulty expression of Bishop
Burnet. He says Lord Clarendon “had too much levity of wit.”
One would think he was rather speaking of the Duke of Buckingham’s
buffoonery, when he carried the fire shovel and tongs to
mimic the Chancellor’s mace and purse. Burnet meant Lord
Clarendon’s want of judgment in venting his satiric humour too
incautiously against his enemies. (Burnet’s History of His Own
Time, vol. i. p. 95.) I am disposed to think that Burnet referred
to Clarendon’s freedom in private, especially at his own table, for
he was always of very convivial habits. This interpretation is
rather strengthened by the words which follow the passage
quoted, viz., “and he did not always observe the decorum of his
post.”—E.</p></div>

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
